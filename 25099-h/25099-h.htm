<h2>HISTORY<sup><a href="#fn.i.1" name="fna.i.1" id="fna.i.1">1</a></sup></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> theme is history. It is an old subject, which has
been discoursed about since Herodotus, and I should be
vain indeed if I flattered myself that I could say aught
new concerning the methods of writing it, when this has
for so long a period engaged the minds of so many gifted
men. Yet to a sympathetic audience, to people who love
history, there is always the chance that a fresh treatment
may present the commonplaces in some different combination,
and augment for the moment an interest which is
perennial.</p>

<p>Holding a brief for history as do I your representative,
let me at once concede that it is not the highest form of
intellectual endeavor; let us at once agree that it were
better that all the histories ever written were burned than
for the world to lose Homer and Shakespeare. Yet as it
is generally true that an advocate rarely admits anything
without qualification, I should not be loyal to my client
did I not urge that Shakespeare was historian as well as
poet. We all prefer his Antony and Cleopatra and Julius
C&aelig;sar to the Lives in North&#8217;s Plutarch which furnished
him his materials. The history is in substance as true as
Plutarch, the dramatic force greater; the language is better
than that of Sir Thomas North, who himself did a
remarkable piece of work when he gave his country a
<a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">2</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>classic by Englishing a French version of the stories of the
Greek. It is true as Macaulay wrote, the historical plays
of Shakespeare have superseded history. When we think
of Henry V, it is of Prince Hal, the boon companion of
Falstaff, who spent his youth in brawl and riot, and then
became a sober and duty-loving king; and our idea of
Richard III. is a deceitful, dissembling, cruel wretch who
knew no touch of pity, a bloody tyrant who knew no law
of God or man.</p>

<p>The Achilles of Homer was a very living personage to
Alexander. How happy he was, said the great general,
when he visited Troy, &ldquo;in having while he lived so faithful
a friend, and when he was dead so famous a poet to proclaim
his actions&rdquo;! In our century, as more in consonance
with society under the régime of contract, when
force has largely given, pay to craft, we feel in greater
sympathy with Ulysses; &ldquo;The one person I would like
to have met and talked with,&rdquo; Froude used to say, &ldquo;was
Ulysses. How interesting it would be to have his opinion
on universal suffrage, and on a House of Parliament where
Thersites is listened to as patiently as the king of men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We may also concede that, in the realm of intellectual
endeavor, the natural and physical sciences should have
the precedence of history. The present is more important
than the past, and those sciences which contribute to our
comfort, place within the reach of the laborer and mechanic
as common necessaries what would have been the
highest luxury to the Roman emperor or to the king of
the Middle Ages, contribute to health and the preservation
of life, and by the development of railroads make possible
such a gathering as this,&mdash;these sciences, we cheerfully
admit, outrank our modest enterprise, which, in the words
of Herodotus, is &ldquo;to preserve from decay the remembrance
<a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">3</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of what men have done.&rdquo; It may be true, as a geologist
once said, in extolling his study at the expense of the
humanities, &ldquo;Rocks do not lie, although men do;&rdquo; yet, on
the other hand, the historic sense, which during our century
has diffused itself widely, has invaded the domain of
physical science. If you are unfortunate enough to be ill,
and consult a doctor, he expatiates on the history of your
disease. It was once my duty to attend the Commencement
exercises of a technical school, when one of the graduates
had a thesis on bridges. As he began by telling
how they were built in Julius C&aelig;sar&#8217;s time, and tracing
at some length the development of the art during the
period of the material prosperity of the Roman Empire, he
had little time and space left to consider their construction
at the present day. One of the most brilliant surgeons
I ever knew, the originator of a number of important
surgical methods, who, being physician as well, was remarkable
in his expedients for saving life when called to
counsel in grave and apparently hopeless cases, desired to
write a book embodying his discoveries and devices, but
said that the feeling was strong within him that he must
begin his work with an account of medicine in Egypt, and
trace its development down to our own time. As he was
a busy man in his profession, he lacked the leisure to make
the preliminary historical study, and his book was never
written. Men of affairs, who, taking &ldquo;the present time
by the top,&rdquo; are looked upon as devoted to the physical
and mechanical sciences, continually pay tribute to our art.
President Garfield, on his deathbed, asked one of his most
trusted Cabinet advisers, in words that become pathetic as
one thinks of the opportunities destroyed by the assassin&#8217;s
bullet, &ldquo;Shall I live in history?&rdquo; A clever politician, who
knew more of ward meetings, caucuses, and the machinery
<a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of conventions than he did of history books, and who was
earnest for the renomination of President Arthur in 1884,
said to me, in the way of clinching his argument, &ldquo;That
administration will live in history.&rdquo; So it was, according
to Amyot, in the olden time. &ldquo;Whensoever,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;the right sage and virtuous Emperor of Rome, Alexander
Severus, was to consult of any matter of great importance,
whether it concerned war or government, he always called
such to counsel as were reported to be well seen in histories.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; demanded Cicero of Atticus, &ldquo;will history say of me
six hundred years hence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Proper concessions being made to poetry and the physical
sciences, our place in the field remains secure. Moreover,
we live in a fortunate age; for was there ever so propitious a
time for writing history as in the last forty years? There
has been a general acquisition of the historic sense. The
methods of teaching history have so improved that they may
be called scientific. Even as the chemist and physicist, we
talk of practice in the laboratory. Most biologists will accept
Haeckel&#8217;s designation of &ldquo;the last forty years as the age of
Darwin,&rdquo; for the theory of evolution is firmly established.
The publication of the Origin of Species, in 1859, converted
it from a poet&#8217;s dream and philosopher&#8217;s speculation to a
well-demonstrated scientific theory. Evolution, heredity,
environment, have become household words, and their
application to history has influenced every one who has
had to trace the development of a people, the growth of an
institution, or the establishment of a cause. Other scientific
theories and methods have affected physical science as
potently, but none has entered so vitally into the study of
man. What hitherto the eye of genius alone could perceive
may become the common property of every one who
cares to read a dozen books. But with all of our advantages,
<a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>do we write better history than was written before the year
1859, which we may call the line of demarcation between the
old and the new? If the English, German, and American
historical scholars should vote as to who were the two best
historians, I have little doubt that Thucydides and Tacitus
would have a pretty large majority. If they were asked
to name a third choice, it would undoubtedly lie between
Herodotus and Gibbon. At the meeting of this association
in Cleveland, when methods of historical teaching were under
discussion, Herodotus and Thucydides, but no others, were
mentioned as proper object lessons. What are the merits
of Herodotus? Accuracy in details, as we understand it,
was certainly not one of them. Neither does he sift critically
his facts, but intimates that he will not make a positive
decision in the case of conflicting testimony. &ldquo;For myself,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;my duty is to report all that is said, but I am not
obliged to believe it all alike,&mdash;a remark which may be
understood to apply to my whole history.&rdquo; He had none of
the wholesome skepticism which we deem necessary in the
weighing of historical evidence; on the contrary, he is
frequently accused of credulity. Nevertheless, Percy Gardner
calls his narrative nobler than that of Thucydides, and
Mahaffy terms it an &ldquo;incomparable history.&rdquo; &ldquo;The truth
is,&rdquo; wrote Macaulay in his diary, when he was forty-nine
years old, &ldquo;I admire no historians much except Herodotus,
Thucydides, and Tacitus.&rdquo; Sir M.&nbsp;E. Grant Duff devoted
his presidential address of 1895, before the Royal Historical
Society, wholly to Herodotus, ending with the conclusion,
&ldquo;The fame of Herodotus, which has a little waned, will
surely wax again.&rdquo; Whereupon the London Times devoted
a leader to the subject. &ldquo;We are concerned,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;to
hear, on authority so eminent, that one of the most delightful
writers of antiquity has a little waned of late in favor with the
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>world. If this indeed be the case, so much the worse for
the world&hellip;. When Homer and Dante and Shakespeare
are neglected, then will Herodotus cease to be read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There we have the secret of his hold upon the minds of
men. He knows how to tell a story, said Professor Hart,
in the discussion previously referred to, in Cleveland. He
has &ldquo;an epic unity of plan,&rdquo; writes Professor Jebb. Herodotus
has furnished delight to all generations, while Polybius,
more accurate and painstaking, a learned historian and a
practical statesman, gathers dust on the shelf or is read as a
penance. Nevertheless, it may be demonstrated from the
historical literature of England of our century that literary
style and great power of narration alone will not give a man
a niche in the temple of history. Herodotus showed diligence
and honesty, without which his other qualities would
have failed to secure him the place he holds in the estimation
of historical scholars.</p>

<p>From Herodotus we naturally turn to Thucydides, who in
the beginning charms historical students by his impression
of the seriousness and dignity of his business. History, he
writes, will be &ldquo;found profitable by those who desire an
exact knowledge of the past as a key to the future, which in
all human probability will repeat or resemble the past. My
history is an everlasting possession, not a prize composition
which is heard and forgotten.&rdquo; Diligence, accuracy, love
of truth, and impartiality are merits commonly ascribed to
Thucydides, and the internal evidence of the history bears
out fully the general opinion. But, in my judgment, there
is a tendency to rate, in the comparative estimates, the
Athenian too high, for the possession of these qualities; for
certainly some modern writers have possessed all of these
merits in an eminent degree. When Jowett wrote in the preface
to his translation, Thucydides &ldquo;stands absolutely alone
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>among the historians, not only of Hellas, but of the world, in
his impartiality and love of truth,&rdquo; he was unaware that a
son of his own university was writing the history of a momentous
period of his own country, in a manner to impugn the
correctness of that statement. When the Jowett Thucydides
appeared, Samuel R. Gardiner had published eight volumes
of his history, though he had not reached the great Civil War,
and his reputation, which has since grown with a cumulative
force, was not fully established; but I have now no hesitation
in saying that the internal evidence demonstrates that in
impartiality and love of truth Gardiner is the peer of Thucydides.
From the point of view of external evidence, the
case is even stronger for Gardiner; he submits to a harder
test. That he has been able to treat so stormy, so controverted,
and so well known a period as the seventeenth
century in England, with hardly a question of his impartiality,
is a wonderful tribute. In fact, in an excellent
review of his work I have seen him criticised for being too
impartial. On the other hand, Grote thinks that he has
found Thucydides in error,&mdash;in the long dialogue between
the Athenian representatives and the Melians. &ldquo;This dialogue,&rdquo;
Grote writes, &ldquo;can hardly represent what actually
passed, except as to a few general points which the historian
has followed out into deductions and illustrations, thus
dramatizing the given situation in a powerful and characteristic
manner.&rdquo; Those very words might characterize Shakespeare&#8217;s
account of the assassination of Julius C&aelig;sar, and his
reproduction of the speeches of Brutus and Mark Antony.
Compare the relation in Plutarch with the third act of the
tragedy, and see how, in his amplification of the story, Shakespeare
has remained true to the essential facts of the time.
Plutarch gives no account of the speeches of Brutus and
Mark Antony, confining himself, to an allusion to the one,
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and a reference to the other; but Appian of Alexandria, in
his history, has reported them. The speeches in Appian
lack the force which they have in Shakespeare, nor do they
seemingly fit into the situation as well. I have adverted
to this criticism of Grote, not that I love Thucydides less,
but that I love Shakespeare more. For my part, the historian&#8217;s
candid acknowledgment in the beginning has convinced
me of the essential&mdash;not the literal&mdash;truth of his
accounts of speeches and dialogues. &ldquo;As to the speeches,&rdquo;
wrote the Athenian, &ldquo;which were made either before or
during the war, it was hard for me, and for others who
reported them to me, to recollect the exact words. I have
therefore put into the mouth of each speaker the sentiments
proper to the occasion, expressed as I thought he would be
likely to express them; while at the same time I endeavored,
as nearly as I could, to give the general purport of what
was actually said.&rdquo; That is the very essence of candor.
But be the historian as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, he
shall not escape calumny. Mahaffy declares that, &ldquo;although
all modern historians quote Thucydides with more confidence
than they would quote the Gospels,&rdquo; the Athenian has
exaggerated; he is one-sided, partial, misleading, dry, and
surly. Other critics agree with Mahaffy that he has been
unjust to Cleon, and has screened Nicias from blame that was
his due for defective generalship.</p>

<p>We approach Tacitus with respect. We rise from reading
his Annals, his History, and his Germany with reverence.
We know that we have been in the society of a gentleman
who had a high standard of morality and honor. We feel
that our guide was a serious student, a solid thinker, and a
man of the world; that he expressed his opinions and delivered
his judgments with a remarkable freedom from
prejudice. He draws us to him with sympathy. He
<a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sounds the same mournful note which we detect in Thucydides.
Tacitus deplores the folly and dissoluteness of the
rulers of his nation; he bewails the misfortunes of his country.
The merits we ascribe to Thucydides, diligence, accuracy,
love of truth, impartiality, are his. The desire to quote
from Tacitus is irresistible. &ldquo;The more I meditate,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;on the events of ancient and modern times, the more
I am struck with the capricious uncertainty which mocks
the calculations of men in all their transactions.&rdquo; Again:
&ldquo;Possibly there is in all things a kind of cycle, and there may
be moral revolutions just as there are changes of seasons.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Commonplaces!&rdquo; sneer the scientific historians. True
enough, but they might not have been commonplaces if
Tacitus had not uttered them, and his works had not been
read and re-read until they have become a common possession
of historical students. From a thinker who deemed the time
&ldquo;out of joint,&rdquo; as Tacitus obviously did, and who, had he not
possessed great strength of mind and character, might
have lapsed into a gloomy pessimism, what noble words are
these: &ldquo;This I regard as history&#8217;s highest function: to let no
worthy action be uncommemorated, and to hold out the
reprobation of posterity as a terror to evil words and deeds.&rdquo;
The modesty of the Roman is fascinating. &ldquo;Much of what
I have related,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and shall have to relate, may
perhaps, I am aware, seem petty trifles to record&hellip;. My
labors are circumscribed and unproductive of renown to
the author.&rdquo; How agreeable to place in contrast with this
the prophecy of his friend, the younger Pliny, in a letter to
the historian: &ldquo;I augur&mdash;nor does my augury deceive me&mdash;that
your histories will be immortal: hence all the more do
I desire to find a place in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To my mind, one of the most charming things in historical
literature is the praise which one great historian bestows
<a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>upon another. Gibbon speaks of &ldquo;the discerning eye&rdquo;
and &ldquo;masterly pencil of Tacitus,&mdash;the first of historians
who applied the science of philosophy to the study of facts,&rdquo;
&ldquo;whose writings will instruct the last generations of mankind.&rdquo;
He has produced an immortal work, &ldquo;every sentence
of which is pregnant with the deepest observations and
most lively images.&rdquo; I mention Gibbon, for it is more than
a strong probability that in diligence, accuracy, and love of
truth he is the equal of Tacitus. A common edition of the
History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is
that with notes by Dean Milman, Guizot, and Dr. Smith.
Niebuhr, Villemain, and Sir James Mackintosh are each
drawn upon for criticism. Did ever such a fierce light beat
upon a history? With what keen relish do the annotators
pounce upon mistakes or inaccuracies, and in that portion of
the work which ends with the fall of the Western Empire
how few do they find! Would Tacitus stand the supreme
test better? There is, so far as I know, only one case in
which we may compare his Annals with an original record.
On bronze tablets found at Lyons in the sixteenth century
is engraved the same speech made by the Emperor Claudius
to the Senate that Tacitus reports. &ldquo;Tacitus and the tablets,&rdquo;
writes Professor Jebb, &ldquo;disagree hopelessly in language
and in nearly all the detail, but agree in the general
line of argument.&rdquo; Gibbon&#8217;s work has richly deserved its
life of more than one hundred years, a period which I believe
no other modern history has endured. Niebuhr, in a course
of lectures at Bonn, in 1829, said that Gibbon&#8217;s &ldquo;work will
never be excelled.&rdquo; At the Gibbon Centenary Commemoration
in London, in 1894, many distinguished men, among
whom the Church had a distinct representation, gathered
together to pay honor to him who, in the words of Frederic
Harrison, had written &ldquo;the most perfect book that
<a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>English prose (outside its fiction) possesses.&rdquo; Mommsen, prevented
by age and work from being present, sent his tribute.
No one, he said, would in the future be able to read the history
of the Roman Empire unless he read Edward Gibbon.
The Times, in a leader devoted to the subject, apparently
expressed the general voice: &ldquo;<span class="lthinsp">&lsquo;Back</span> to Gibbon&rsquo; is already,
both here and among the scholars of Germany and France,
the watchword of the younger historians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have now set forth certain general propositions which,
with time for adducing the evidence in detail, might, I
think, be established: that, in the consensus of learned
people, Thucydides and Tacitus stand at the head of historians;
and that it is not alone their accuracy, love of truth,
and impartiality which entitle them to this preëminence
since Gibbon and Gardiner among the moderns possess
equally the same qualities. What is it, then, that makes
these men supreme? In venturing a solution of this question,
I confine myself necessarily to the English translations
of the Greek and Latin authors. We have thus a common
denominator of language, and need not take into account
the unrivaled precision and terseness of the Greek and the
force and clearness of the Latin. It seems to me that one
special merit of Thucydides and Tacitus is their compressed
narrative,&mdash;that they have related so many events and put
so much meaning in so few words. Our manner of writing
history is really curious. The histories which cover long
periods of time are brief; those which have to do with but
a few years are long. The works of Thucydides and Tacitus
are not like our compendiums of history, which merely touch
on great affairs, since want of space precludes any elaboration.
Tacitus treats of a comparatively short epoch, Thucydides
of a much shorter one: both histories are brief. Thucydides
and Macaulay are examples of extremes. The Athenian
<a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>tells the story of twenty-four years in one volume;
the Englishman takes nearly five volumes of equal size for
his account of seventeen years. But it is safe to say that
Thucydides tells us as much that is worth knowing as
Macaulay. One is concise, the other is not. It is impossible
to paraphrase the fine parts of Thucydides, but Macaulay
lends himself readily to such an exercise. The thought of
the Athenian is so close that he has got rid of all redundancies
of expression: hence the effort to reproduce his ideas in
other words fails. The account of the plague in Athens
has been studied and imitated, and every imitation falls
short of the original not only in vividness but in brevity.
It is the triumph of art that in this and in other splendid
portions we wish more had been told. As the French say,
&ldquo;the secret of wearying is to say all,&rdquo; and this the Athenian
thoroughly understood. Between our compendiums, which
tell too little, and our long general histories, which tell too
much, are Thucydides and Tacitus.</p>

<p>Again, it is a common opinion that our condensed histories
lack life and movement. This is due in part to their
being written generally from a study of second-hand&mdash;not
original&mdash;materials. Those of the Athenian and the
Roman are mainly the original.</p>

<p>I do not think, however, that we may infer that we have
a much greater mass of materials, and thereby excuse our
modern prolixity. In written documents, of course, we exceed
the ancients, for we have been flooded with these by
the art of printing. Yet any one who has investigated any
period knows how the same facts are told over and over
again, in different ways, by various writers; and if one can
get beyond the mass of verbiage and down to the really
significant original material, what a simplification of ideas
there is, what a lightening of the load! I own that this
<a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>process of reduction is painful, and thereby our work is made
more difficult than that of the ancients. A historian will
adapt himself naturally to the age in which he lives, and
Thucydides made use of the matter that was at his hand.
&ldquo;Of the events of the war,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I have not ventured
to speak from any chance information, nor according to any
notion of my own; I have described nothing but what I
either saw myself, or learned from others of whom I made
the most careful and particular inquiry. The task was a
laborious one, because eye-witnesses of the same occurrences
gave different accounts of them, as they remembered or
were interested in the actions of one side or the other.&rdquo; His
materials, then, were what he saw and heard. His books
and his manuscripts were living men. Our distinguished
military historian, John C. Ropes, whose untimely death we
deplore, might have written his history from the same sort
of materials; for he was contemporary with our Civil War,
and followed the daily events with intense interest. A
brother of his was killed at Gettysburg, and he had many
friends in the army. He paid at least one memorable visit
to Meade&#8217;s headquarters in the field, and at the end of the
war had a mass of memories and impressions of the great
conflict. He never ceased his inquiries; he never lost a
chance to get a particular account from those who took
part in battles or campaigns; and before he began his Story
of the Civil War, he too could have said, &ldquo;I made the most
careful and particular inquiry&rdquo; of generals and officers on
both sides, and of men in civil office privy to the great
transactions. His knowledge drawn from living lips was
marvelous, and his conversation, when he poured this knowledge
forth, often took the form of a flowing narrative in an
animated style. While there are not, so far as I remember,
any direct references in his two volumes to these memories,
<a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>or to memoranda of conversations which he had with living
actors after the close of the war drama, and while his main
authority is the Official Records of the Union and Confederate
Armies,&mdash;which, no one appreciated better than he,
were unique historical materials,&mdash;nevertheless this personal
knowledge trained his judgment and gave color to
his narrative.</p>

<p>It is pretty clear that Thucydides spent a large part of a
life of about threescore years and ten in gathering materials
and writing his history. The mass of facts which he set
down or stored away in his memory must have been enormous.
He was a man of business, and had a home in
Thrace as well as in Athens, traveling probably at fairly
frequent intervals between the two places; but the main
portion of the first forty years of his life was undoubtedly
spent in Athens, where, during those glorious years of peace
and the process of beautifying the city, he received the best
education a man could get. To walk about the city and
view the buildings and statues was both directly and insensibly
a refining influence. As Thucydides himself, in
the funeral oration of Pericles, said of the works which the
Athenian saw around him, &ldquo;the daily delight of them
banishes gloom.&rdquo; There was the opportunity to talk with as
good conversers as the world has ever known; and he undoubtedly
saw much of the men who were making history.
There was the great theater and the sublime poetry. In a
word, the life of Thucydides was adapted to the gathering of
a mass of historical materials of the best sort; and his daily
walk, his reading, his intense thought, gave him an intellectual
grasp of the facts he has so ably handled. Of course
he was a genius, and he wrote in an effective literary style;
but seemingly his natural parts and acquired talents are
directed to this: a digestion of his materials, and a
<a name="png.023" id="png.023"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>compression of his narrative without taking the vigor out of his
story in a manner I believe to be without parallel. He
devoted a life to writing a volume. His years after the
peace was broken, his career as a general, his banishment
and enforced residence in Thrace, his visit to the countries
of the Peloponnesian allies with whom Athens was at war,&mdash;all
these gave him a signal opportunity to gather materials,
and to assimilate them in the gathering. We may fancy
him looking at an alleged fact on all sides, and turning it over
and over in his mind; we know that he must have meditated
long on ideas, opinions, and events; and the result is a brief,
pithy narrative. Tradition hath it that Demosthenes copied
out this history eight times, or even learned it by heart.
Chatham, urging the removal of the forces from Boston, had
reason to refer to the history of Greece, and, that he might
impress it upon the lords that he knew whereof he spoke,
declared, &ldquo;I have read Thucydides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of Tacitus likewise is conciseness a well-known merit.
Living in an age of books and libraries, he drew more from
the written word than did Thucydides; and his method of
working, therefore, resembled more our own. These are common
expressions of his: &ldquo;It is related by most of the writers
of those times;&rdquo; I adopt the account &ldquo;in which the authors
are agreed;&rdquo; this account &ldquo;agrees with those of the other
writers.&rdquo; Relating a case of recklessness of vice in Messalina,
he acknowledges that it will appear fabulous, and asserts
his truthfulness thus: &ldquo;But I would not dress up my narrative
with fictions, to give it an air of marvel, rather than
relate what has been stated to me or written by my seniors.&rdquo;
He also speaks of the authority of tradition, and tells what he
remembers &ldquo;to have heard from aged men.&rdquo; He will not
paraphrase the eloquence of Seneca after he had his veins
opened, because the very words of the philosopher had been
<a name="png.024" id="png.024"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>published; but when, a little later, Flavius the tribune came
to die, the historian gives this report of his defiance of Nero.
&ldquo;I hated you,&rdquo; the tribune said to the emperor; &ldquo;nor had
you a soldier more true to you while you deserved to be loved.
I began to hate you from the time you showed yourself
the impious murderer of your mother and your wife, a
charioteer, a stage-player, an incendiary.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have given
the very words,&rdquo; Tacitus adds, &ldquo;because they were not,
like those of Seneca, published, though the rough and vigorous
sentiments of a soldier ought to be no less known.&rdquo;
Everywhere we see in Tacitus, as in Thucydides, a dislike of
superfluous detail, a closeness of thought, a compression of
language. He was likewise a man of affairs, but his life
work was his historical writings, which, had we all of them,
would fill probably four moderate-sized octavo volumes.</p>

<p>To sum up, then: Thucydides and Tacitus are superior
to the historians who have written in our century, because,
by long reflection and studious method, they have better
digested their materials and compressed their narrative.
Unity in narration has been adhered to more rigidly. They
stick closer to their subject. They are not allured into the
fascinating bypaths of narration, which are so tempting to
men who have accumulated a mass of facts, incidents, and
opinions. One reason why Macaulay is so prolix is because
he could not resist the temptation to treat events which had
a picturesque side and which were suited to his literary
style; so that, as John Morley says, &ldquo;in many portions of
his too elaborated history of William III. he describes a
large number of events about which, I think, no sensible man
can in the least care either how they happened, or whether
indeed they happened at all or not.&rdquo; If I am right in my
supposition that Thucydides and Tacitus had a mass of
materials, they showed reserve and discretion in throwing a
<a name="png.025" id="png.025"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>large part of them away, as not being necessary or important
to the posterity for which they were writing. This could
only be the result of a careful comparison of their materials,
and of long meditation on their relative value. I suspect
that they cared little whether a set daily task was accomplished
or not; for if you propose to write only one large
volume or four moderate-sized volumes in a lifetime, art is
not too long nor is life too short.</p>

<p>Another superiority of the classical historians, as I reckon,
arose from the fact that they wrote what was practically
contemporaneous history. Herodotus was born 484&nbsp;<span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>,
and the most important and accurate part of his history is
the account of the Persian invasion which took place four
years later. The case of Thucydides is more remarkable.
Born in 471&nbsp;<span class="smcap lc">B.C.</span>, he relates the events which happened
between 435 and 411, when he was between the ages of
thirty-six and sixty. Tacitus, born in 52&nbsp;<span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span>, covered
with his Annals and History the years between 14 and 96.
&ldquo;Herodotus and Thucydides belong to an age in which the
historian draws from life and for life,&rdquo; writes Professor Jebb.
It is manifestly easier to describe a life you know than one
you must imagine, which is what you must do if you aim to
relate events which took place before your own and your
father&#8217;s time. In many treatises which have been written
demanding an extraordinary equipment for the historian, it
is generally insisted that he shall have a fine constructive
imagination; for how can he re-create his historic period
unless he live in it? In the same treatises it is asserted that
contemporary history cannot be written correctly, for impartiality
in the treatment of events near at hand is impossible.
Therefore the canon requires the quality of a
great poet, and denies that there may be had the merit of a
judge in a country where there are no great poets, but where
<a name="png.026" id="png.026"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>candid judges abound. Does not the common rating of
Thucydides and Tacitus refute the dictum that history within
the memory of men living cannot be written truthfully and
fairly? Given, then, the judicial mind, how much easier to
write it! The rare quality of a poet&#8217;s imagination is no
longer necessary, for your boyhood recollections, your
youthful experiences, your successes and failures of manhood,
the grandfather&#8217;s tales, the parent&#8217;s recollections,
the conversation in society,&mdash;all these put you in vital
touch with the life you seek to describe. These not only
give color and freshness to the vivifying of the facts you
must find in the record, but they are in a way materials
themselves, not strictly authentic, but of the kind that direct
you in search and verification. Not only is no extraordinary
ability required to write contemporary history, but the labor
of the historian is lightened, and Dryasdust is no longer his
sole guide. The funeral oration of Pericles is pretty nearly
what was actually spoken, or else it is the substance of the
speech written out in the historian&#8217;s own words. Its intensity
of feeling and the fitting of it so well into the situation
indicate it to be a living contemporaneous document, and at
the same time it has that universal application which we
note in so many speeches of Shakespeare. A few years after
our Civil War, a lawyer in a city of the middle West, who had
been selected to deliver the Memorial Day oration, came
to a friend of his in despair because he could write nothing
but the commonplaces about those who had died for the
Union and for the freedom of a race which had been uttered
many times before, and he asked for advice. &ldquo;Take the
funeral oration of Pericles for a model,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;Use his words where they will fit, and dress up the rest to
suit our day.&rdquo; The orator was surprised to find how much
of the oration could be used bodily, and how much, with
<a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>adaptation, was germane to his subject. But slight alterations
are necessary to make the opening sentence this:
&ldquo;Most of those who have spoken here have commended the
law-giver who added this oration to our other customs;
it seemed to them a worthy thing that such an honor should
be given to the dead who have fallen on the field of battle.&rdquo;
In many places you may let the speech run on with hardly a
change. &ldquo;In the face of death [these men] resolved to rely
upon themselves alone. And when the moment came they
were minded to resist and suffer rather than to fly and save
their lives; they ran away from the word of dishonor, but
on the battlefield their feet stood fast; and while for a moment
they were in the hands of fortune, at the height, not of
terror, but of glory, they passed away. Such was the end of
these men; they were worthy of their country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Consider for a moment, as the work of a contemporary, the
book which continues the account of the Sicilian expedition,
and ends with the disaster at Syracuse. &ldquo;In the describing
and reporting whereof,&rdquo; Plutarch writes, &ldquo;Thucydides hath
gone beyond himself, both for variety and liveliness of narration,
as also in choice and excellent words.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no
prose composition in the world,&rdquo; wrote Macaulay, &ldquo;which I
place so high as the seventh book of Thucydides&hellip;. I was
delighted to find in Gray&#8217;s letters, the other day, this query to
Wharton: &lsquo;The retreat from Syracuse,&mdash;is it or is it not the
finest thing you ever read in your <span class="rthinsp">life?&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; In the Annals of
Tacitus we have an account of part of the reign of Emperor
Nero, which is intense in its interest as the picture of a state
of society that would be incredible, did we not know that
our guide was a truthful man. One rises from a perusal of
this with the trite expression, &ldquo;Truth is stranger than
fiction;&rdquo; and one need only compare the account of Tacitus
with the romance of Quo Vadis to be convinced that true
<a name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">20</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>history is more interesting than a novel. One of the most
vivid impressions I ever had came immediately after
reading the story of Nero and Agrippina in Tacitus, from a
view of the statue of Agrippina in the National Museum
at Naples.<sup><a href="#fn.i.2" name="fna.i.2" id="fna.i.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It will be worth our while now to sum up what I think
may be established with sufficient time and care. Natural
ability being presupposed, the qualities necessary for a
historian are diligence, accuracy, love of truth, impartiality,
the thorough digestion of his materials by careful selection
and long meditating, and the compression of his narrative
into the smallest compass consistent with the life of his story.
He must also have a power of expression suitable for his
purpose. All these qualities, we have seen, were possessed
by Thucydides and Tacitus; and we have seen furthermore
that, by bringing to bear these endowments and acquirements
upon contemporary history, their success has been
greater than it would have been had they treated a more
distant period. Applying these considerations to the writing
of history in America, it would seem that all we have
to gain in method, in order that when the genius appears
he shall rival the great Greek and the great Roman, is thorough
assimilation of materials and rigorous conciseness
in relation. I admit that the two things we lack are difficult
to get as our own. In the collection of materials, in criticism
and detailed analysis, in the study of cause and effect, in
applying the principle of growth, of evolution, we certainly
surpass the ancients. But if we live in the age of Darwin,
we also live in an age of newspapers and magazines, when,
as Lowell said, not only great events, but a vast &ldquo;number of
trivial incidents, are now recorded, and this dust of time gets
<a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in our eyes&rdquo;; when distractions are manifold; when the desire
&ldquo;to see one&#8217;s name in print&rdquo; and make books takes possession
of us all. If one has something like an original idea or
a fresh combination of truisms, one obtains easily a hearing.
The hearing once had, something of a success being made, the
writer is urged by magazine editors and by publishers for
more. The good side of this is apparent. It is certainly a
wholesome indication that a demand exists for many serious
books, but the evil is that one is pressed to publish his
thoughts before he has them fully matured. The periods of
fruitful meditation out of which emerged the works of
Thucydides and Tacitus seem not to be a natural incident of
our time. To change slightly the meaning of Lowell, &ldquo;the
bustle of our lives keeps breaking the thread of that attention
which is the material of memory, till no one has patience
to spin from it a continuous thread of thought.&rdquo; We have
the defects of our qualities. Nevertheless, I am struck
with the likeness between a common attribute of the Greeks
and Matthew Arnold&#8217;s characterization of the Americans.
Greek thought, it is said, goes straight to the mark, and
penetrates like an arrow. The Americans, Arnold wrote,
&ldquo;think straight and see clear.&rdquo; Greek life was adapted to
meditation. American quickness and habit of taking the
short cut to the goal make us averse to the patient and elaborate
method of the ancients. In manner of expression,
however, we have improved. The Fourth of July spread-eagle
oration, not uncommon even in New England in former
days, would now be listened to hardly anywhere without
merriment. In a Lowell Institute lecture in 1855 Lowell
said, &ldquo;In modern times, the desire for startling expression
is so strong that people hardly think a thought is good for
anything unless it goes off with a <em>pop</em>, like a ginger-beer
cork.&rdquo; No one would thus characterize our present writing.
<a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Between reserve in expression and reserve in thought there
must be interaction. We may hope, therefore, that the
trend in the one will become the trend in the other, and that
we may look for as great historians in the future as in the
past. The Thucydides or Tacitus of the future will write
his history from the original materials, knowing that there
only will he find the living spirit; but he will have the helps of
the modern world. He will have at his hand monographs of
students whom the professors of history in our colleges are
teaching with diligence and wisdom, and he will accept these
aids with thankfulness in his laborious search. He will have
grasped the generalizations and methods of physical science,
but he must know to the bottom his Thucydides and Tacitus.
He will recognize in Homer and Shakespeare the great
historians of human nature, and he will ever attempt,
although feeling that failure is certain, to wrest from them
their secret of narration, to acquire their art of portrayal
of character. He must be a man of the world, but equally
well a man of the academy. If, like Thucydides and Tacitus,
the American historian chooses the history of his own
country as his field, he may infuse his patriotism into his
narrative. He will speak of the broad acres and their
products, the splendid industrial development due to the
capacity and energy of the captains of industry; but he will
like to dwell on the universities and colleges, on the great
numbers seeking a higher education, on the morality of the
people, their purity of life, their domestic happiness. He
will never be weary of referring to Washington and Lincoln,
feeling that a country with such exemplars is indeed one to
awaken envy, and he will not forget the brave souls who
followed where they led. I like to think of the Memorial
Day orator, speaking thirty years ago with his mind full of
the Civil War and our Revolution, giving utterance to these
<a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>noble words of Pericles: &ldquo;I would have you day by day fix
your eyes upon the greatness of your country, until you become
filled with love of her; and when you are impressed by
the spectacle of her glory, reflect that this empire has been
acquired by men who knew their duty and had the courage
to do it; who in the hour of conflict had the fear of dishonor
always present to them; and who, if ever they failed in an
enterprise, would not allow their virtues to be lost to their
country, but freely gave their lives to her as the fairest
offering which they could present at her feast. They received
each one for himself a praise which grows not old,
and the noblest of all sepulchers. For the whole earth is
the sepulcher of illustrious men; not only are they commemorated
by columns and inscriptions in their own country,
but in foreign lands there dwells also an unwritten
memorial of them, graven not on stone, but in the hearts of
men.&rdquo;</p>

 /></span>CONCERNING THE WRITING OF HISTORY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Called</span> on at the last moment, owing to the illness of Mr.
Eggleston, to take the place of one whose absence can never
be fully compensated, I present to you a paper on the writing
of history. It is in a way a continuance of my inaugural
address before this association one year ago, and despite
the continuity of the thought I have endeavored to treat the
same subject from a different point of view. While going
over the same ground and drawing my lessons from the same
historians, it is new matter so far as I have had the honor to
present it to the American Historical Association.</p>

<p>A historian, to make a mark, must show some originality
somewhere in his work. The originality may be in a method
of investigation; it may be in the use of some hitherto inaccessible
or unprinted material; it may be in the employment
of some sources of information open to everybody, but not
before used, or it may be in a fresh combination of well-known
and well-elaborated facts. It is this last-named feature
that leads Mr. Winsor to say, in speaking of the different
views that may be honestly maintained from working over
the same material, &ldquo;The study of history is perennial.&rdquo; I
think I can make my meaning clearer as to the originality one
should try to infuse into historical work by drawing an illustration
from the advice of a literary man as to the art of
writing. Charles Dudley Warner once said to me, &ldquo;Every
one who writes should have something to add to the world&#8217;s
stock of knowledge or literary expression. If he falls
<a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>unconsciously into imitation or quotation, he takes away from
his originality. No matter if some great writer has expressed
the thought in better language than you can use, if you take
his words you detract from your own originality. Express
your thought feebly in your own way rather than with
strength by borrowing the words of another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This same principle in the art of authorship may be applied
to the art of writing history. &ldquo;Follow your own star,&rdquo;
said Emerson, &ldquo;and it will lead you to that which none
other can attain. Imitation is suicide. You must take
yourself for better or worse as your own portion.&rdquo; Any one
who is bent upon writing history, may be sure that there is
in him some originality, that he can add something to the
knowledge of some period. Let him give himself to meditation,
to searching out what epoch and what kind of treatment
of that epoch is best adapted to his powers and to his
training. I mean not only the collegiate training, but the
sort of training one gets consciously or unconsciously from
the very circumstances of one&#8217;s life. In the persistence of
thinking, his subject will flash upon him. Parkman, said
Lowell, showed genius in the choice of his subject. The
recent biography of Parkman emphasizes the idea which
we get from his works&mdash;that only a man who lived in the
virgin forests of this country and loved them, and who had
traveled in the far West as a pioneer, with Indians for companions,
could have done that work. Parkman&#8217;s experience
cannot be had by any one again, and he brought to bear the
wealth of it in that fifty years&#8217; occupation of his. Critics of
exact knowledge&mdash;such as Justin Winsor, for instance&mdash;find
limitations in Parkman&#8217;s books that may impair the
permanence of his fame, but I suspect that his is the only
work in American history that cannot and will not be written
over again. The reason of it is that he had a unique
<a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>life which has permeated his narrative, giving it the stamp of
originality. No man whose training had been gained wholly
in the best schools of Germany, France, or England could
have written those books. A training racy of the soil was
needed. &ldquo;A practical knowledge,&rdquo; wrote Niebuhr, &ldquo;must
support historical jurisprudence, and if any one has got that
he can easily master all scholastic speculations.&rdquo; A man&#8217;s
knowledge of everyday life in some way fits him for a certain
field of historical study&mdash;in that field lies success. In
seeking a period, no American need confine himself to his
own country. &ldquo;European history for Americans,&rdquo; said
Motley, &ldquo;has to be almost entirely rewritten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shall touch upon only two of the headings of historical
originality which I have mentioned. The first that I shall
speak of is the employment of some sources of information
open to everybody, but not before used. A significant case
of this in American history is the use which Doctor von
Holst made of newspaper material. <cite>Niles&#8217;s Register</cite>, a lot
of newspaper cuttings, as well as speeches and state papers
in a compact form, had, of course, been referred to by many
writers who dealt with the period they covered, but in the
part of his history covering the ten years from 1850 to 1860
von Holst made an extensive and varied employment of
newspapers by studying the newspaper files themselves.
As the aim of history is truth, and as newspapers fail sadly
in accuracy, it is not surprising that many historical students
believe that the examination of newspapers for any given
period will not pay for the labor and drudgery involved;
but the fact that a trained German historical scholar and
teacher at a German university should have found some
truth in our newspaper files when he came to write the history
of our own country, gives to their use for that period
the seal of scientific approval. Doctor von Holst used this
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>material with pertinence and effect; his touch was nice.
I used to wonder at his knowledge of the newspaper world,
of the men who made and wrote our journals, until he told
me that when he first came to this country one of his methods
in gaining a knowledge of English was to read the advertisements
in the newspapers. Reflection will show one
what a picture of the life of a people this must be, in addition
to the news columns.</p>

<p>No one, of course, will go to newspapers for facts if he can
find those facts in better-attested documents. The haste
with which the daily records of the world&#8217;s doings are made
up precludes sifting and revision. Yet in the decade between
1850 and 1860 you will find facts in the newspapers
which are nowhere else set down. Public men of commanding
position were fond of writing letters to the journals
with a view to influencing public sentiment. These letters
in the newspapers are as valuable historical material as if
they were carefully collected, edited, and published in the
form of books. Speeches were made which must be read,
and which will be found nowhere but in the journals.
The immortal debates of Lincoln and Douglas in 1858 were
never put into a book until 1860, existing previously only
in newspaper print. Newspapers are sometimes important
in fixing a date and in establishing the whereabouts of a man.
If, for example, a writer draws a fruitful inference from
the alleged fact that President Lincoln went to see Edwin
Booth play Hamlet in Washington in February, 1863, and
if one finds by a consultation of the newspaper theatrical
advertisements that Edwin Booth did not visit Washington
during that month, the significance of the inference is destroyed.
Lincoln paid General Scott a memorable visit at
West Point in June, 1862. You may, if I remember correctly,
search the books in vain to get at the exact date of
<a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>this visit; but turn to the newspaper files and you find that
the President left Washington at such an hour on such a day,
arrived at Jersey City at a stated time, and made the transfer
to the other railroad which took him to the station opposite
West Point. The time of his leaving West Point and
the hour of his return to Washington are also given.</p>

<p>The value of newspapers as an indication of public sentiment
is sometimes questioned, but it can hardly be doubted
that the average man will read the newspaper with the
sentiments of which he agrees. &ldquo;I inquired about newspaper
opinion,&rdquo; said Joseph Chamberlain in the House of
Commons last May. &ldquo;I knew no other way of getting at
popular opinion.&rdquo; During the years between 1854 and 1860
the daily journals were a pretty good reflection of public sentiment
in the United States. Wherever, for instance, you
found the <cite>New York Weekly Tribune</cite> largely read, Republican
majorities were sure to be had when election day came.
For fact and for opinion, if you knew the contributors,
statements and editorials by them were entitled to as much
weight as similar public expressions in any other form. You
get to know Greeley and you learn to recognize his style.
Now, an editorial from him is proper historical material,
taking into account always the circumstances under which
he wrote. The same may be said of Dana and of Hildreth,
both editorial writers for the <cite>Tribune</cite>, and of the Washington
despatches of J.&nbsp;S. Pike. It is interesting to compare the
public letters of Greeley to the <cite>Tribune</cite> from Washington in
1856 with his private letters written at the same time to
Dana. There are no misstatements in the public letters,
but there is a suppression of the truth. The explanations
in the private correspondence are clearer, and you need them
to know fully how affairs looked in Washington to Greeley
at the time; but this fact by no means detracts from the
<a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>value of the public letters as historical material. I have
found newspapers of greater value both for fact and opinion
during the decade of 1850 to 1860 than for the period of the
Civil War. A comparison of the newspaper accounts of
battles with the history of them which may be drawn from
the correspondence and reports in the Official Records of
the War of the Rebellion will show how inaccurate and misleading
was the war correspondence of the daily journals.
It could not well be otherwise. The correspondent was
obliged in haste to write the story of a battle of which he saw
but a small section, and instead of telling the little part which
he knew actually, he had to give to a public greedy for news
a complete survey of the whole battlefield. This story was
too often colored by his liking or aversion for the generals in
command. A study of the confidential historical material
of the Civil War, apart from the military operations, in comparison
with the journalistic accounts, gives one a higher
idea of the accuracy and shrewdness of the newspaper correspondents.
Few important things were brewing at Washington
of which they did not get an inkling. But I always
like to think of two signal exceptions. Nothing ever leaked
out in regard to the famous &ldquo;Thoughts for the President&#8217;s
consideration,&rdquo; which Seward submitted to Lincoln in
March, 1861, and only very incorrect guesses of the President&#8217;s
first emancipation proclamation, brought before his
Cabinet in July, 1862, got into newspaper print.</p>

<p>Beware of hasty, strained, and imperfect generalizations.
A historian should always remember that he is a sort of
trustee for his readers. No matter how copious may be his
notes, he cannot fully explain his processes or the reason of
his confidence in one witness and not in another, his belief in
one honest man against a half dozen untrustworthy men,
without such prolixity as to make a general history
<a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>unreadable. Now, in this position as trustee he is bound to assert
nothing for which he has not evidence, as much as an executor
of a will or the trustee for widows and orphans is
obligated to render a correct account of the moneys in his
possession. For this reason Grote has said, &ldquo;An historian
is bound to produce the materials upon which he builds, be
they never so fantastic, absurd, or incredible.&rdquo; Hence the
necessity for footnotes. While mere illustrative and interesting
footnotes are perhaps to be avoided, on account of
their redundancy, those which give authority for the statements
in the text can never be in excess. Many good histories
have undoubtedly been published where the authors
have not printed their footnotes; but they must have had,
nevertheless, precise records for their authorities. The advantage
and necessity of printing the notes is that you furnish
your critic an opportunity of finding you out if you have
mistaken or strained your authorities. Bancroft&#8217;s example
is peculiar. In his earlier volumes he used footnotes, but
in volume vii he changed his plan and omitted notes,
whether of reference or explanation. Nor do you find them
in either of his carefully revised editions. &ldquo;This is done,&rdquo;
Bancroft wrote in the preface to his seventh volume, &ldquo;not
from an unwillingness to subject every statement of fact,
even in its minutest details, to the severest scrutiny; but
from the variety and the multitude of the papers which
have been used and which could not be intelligently cited
without a disproportionate commentary.&rdquo; Again, Blaine&#8217;s
&ldquo;Twenty Years of Congress,&rdquo; a work which, properly weighed,
is not without historical value, is only to be read with great
care on account of his hasty and inaccurate generalizations.
There are evidences of good, honest labor in those two volumes,
much of which must have been done by himself.
There is an aim at truth and impartiality, but many of his
<a name="png.042" id="png.042"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>general statements will seem, to any one who has gone over
the original material, to rest on a slight basis. If Blaine
had felt the necessity of giving authorities in a footnote for
every statement about which there might have been a question,
he certainly would have written an entirely different
sort of a book.</p>

<p>My other head is the originality which comes from a fresh
combination of known historical facts.</p>

<p>I do not now call to mind any more notable chapter which
illustrates this than the chapter of Curtius, &ldquo;The years of
peace.&rdquo; One is perhaps better adapted for the keen enjoyment
of it if he does not know the original material, for his
suspicion that some of the inferences are strained and unwarranted
might become a certainty. But accepting it as a
mature and honest elaboration by one of the greatest historians
of Greece of our day, it is a sample of the vivifying of
dry bones and of a dovetailing of facts and ideas that makes
a narrative to charm and instruct. You feel that the spirit
of that age we all like to think and dream about is there,
and if you have been so fortunate as to visit the Athens of
to-day, that chapter, so great is the author&#8217;s constructive
imagination, carries you back and makes you for the moment
live in the Athens of Pericles, of Sophocles, of Phidias and
Herodotus.</p>

<p>With the abundance of materials for modern history, and,
for that reason, our tendency to diffuseness, nothing is so
important as a thorough acquaintance with the best classic
models, such as Herodotus, Thucydides, and Tacitus. In
Herodotus you have an example of an interesting story with
the unity of the narrative well sustained in spite of certain
unnecessary digressions. His book is obviously a life work
and the work of a man who had an extensive knowledge
gained by reading, social intercourse, and travel, and who
<a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>brought his knowledge to bear upon his chosen task. That
the history is interesting all admit, but in different periods
of criticism stress is sometimes laid on the untrustworthy
character of the narrative, with the result that there has
been danger of striking Herodotus from the list of historical
models; but such is the merit of his work that the Herodotus
cult again revives, and, I take it, is now at its height.
I received, six years ago, while in Egypt, a vivid impression
of him whom we used to style the Father of History.
Spending one day at the great Pyramids, when, after I had
satisfied my first curiosity, after I had filled my eyes and
mind with the novelty of the spectacle, I found nothing so
gratifying to the historic sense as to gaze on those most
wonderful monuments of human industry, constructed certainly
5000 years ago, and to read at the same time the account
that Herodotus gave of his visit there about 2350 years
before the date of my own. That same night I read in a
modern and garish Cairo hotel the current number of the
<cite>London Times</cite>. In it was an account of an annual meeting
of the Royal Historical Society and a report of a formal
and carefully prepared address of its president, whose
subject was &ldquo;Herodotus,&rdquo; whose aim was to point out the
value of the Greek writer as a model to modern historians.
The <cite>Times</cite>, for the moment laying aside its habitual attack
on the then Liberal government, devoted its main leader to
Herodotus&mdash;to his merits and the lessons he conveyed to
the European writers. The article was a remarkable blending
of scholarship and good sense, and I ended the day with
the reflection of what a space in the world&#8217;s history Herodotus
filled, himself describing the work of twenty-six hundred
years before his own time and being dilated on in 1894 by
one of the most modern of nineteenth-century newspapers.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed, I think, that Thucydides is first in
<a name="png.044" id="png.044"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>order of time of philosophic historians, but it does not seem
to me that we have most to learn from him in the philosophic
quality. The tracing of cause and effect, the orderly sequence
of events, is certainly better developed by moderns
than it has been by ancients. The influence of Darwin and
the support and proof which he gives to the doctrine of
evolution furnish a training of thought which was impossible
to the ancients; but Thucydides has digested his material
and compressed his narrative without taking the life out of
his story in a manner to make us despair, and this does not,
I take it, come from paucity of materials. A test which I
began to make as a study in style has helped me in estimating
the solidity of a writer. Washington Irving formed his
style by reading attentively from time to time a page of
Addison and then, closing the book, endeavored to write out
the same ideas in his own words. In this way his style
became assimilated to that of the great English essayist.
I have tried the same mode with several writers. I found
that the plan succeeded with Macaulay and with Lecky. I
tried it again and again with Shakespeare and Hawthorne,
but if I succeeded in writing out the paragraph I found that
it was because I memorized their very words. To write
out their ideas in my own language I found impossible.
I have had the same result with Thucydides in trying to do
this with his description of the plague in Athens. Now, I
reason from this in the case of Shakespeare and Thucydides
that their thought was so concise they themselves got rid of
all redundancies; hence to effect the reproduction of their
ideas in any but their own language is practically impossible.</p>

<p>It is related of Macaulay somewhere in his &ldquo;Life and
Letters,&rdquo; that in a moment of despair, when he instituted
a comparison between his manuscript and the work of
<a name="png.045" id="png.045"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Thucydides, he thought of throwing his into the fire. I
suspect that Macaulay had not the knack of discarding material
on which he had spent time and effort, seeing how
easily such events glowed under his graphic pen. This is
one reason why he is prolix in the last three volumes. The
first two, which begin with the famous introductory chapter
and continue the story through the revolution of 1688
to the accession of William and Mary, seem to me models
of historical composition so far as arrangement, orderly
method, and liveliness of narration go. Another defect of
Macaulay is that, while he was an omnivorous reader and
had a prodigious memory, he was not given to long-continued
and profound reflection. He read and rehearsed his reading
in memory, but he did not give himself to &ldquo;deep, abstract
meditation&rdquo; and did not surrender himself to &ldquo;the fruitful
leisures of the spirit.&rdquo; Take this instance of Macaulay&#8217;s
account of a journey: &ldquo;The express train reached Hollyhead
about 7 in the evening. I read between London
and Bangor the lives of the emperors from Maximin
to Carinus, inclusive, in the Augustine history, and was
greatly amused and interested.&rdquo; On board the steamer:
&ldquo;I put on my greatcoat and sat on deck during the whole
voyage. As I could not read, I used an excellent substitute
for reading. I went through &lsquo;Paradise Lost&rsquo; in my head.
I could still repeat half of it, and that the best half.
I really never enjoyed it so much.&rdquo; In Dublin: &ldquo;The rain
was so heavy that I was forced to come back in a covered
car. While in this detestable vehicle I looked rapidly through
the correspondence between Pliny and Trajan and thought
that Trajan made a most creditable figure.&rdquo; It may be
that Macaulay did not always digest his knowledge well.
Yet in reading his &ldquo;Life and Letters&rdquo; you know that you are
in company with a man who read many books and you give
<a name="png.046" id="png.046"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>faith to Thackeray&#8217;s remark, &ldquo;Macaulay reads twenty books
to write a sentence; he travels a hundred miles to make
a line of description.&rdquo; It is a matter of regret that the
progress of historical criticism and the scientific teaching
of history have had the tendency to drive Macaulay out of
the fashion with students, and I know not whether the good
we used to get out of him thirty-five years ago can now be
got from other sources. For I seem to miss something that
we historical students had a generation ago&mdash;and that is
enthusiasm for the subject. The enthusiasm that we had
then had&mdash;the desire to compass all knowledge, the wish to
gather the fruits of learning and lay them devoutly at the
feet of our chosen muse&mdash;this enthusiasm we owed to
Macaulay and to Buckle. Quite properly, no one reads
Buckle now, and I cannot gainsay what John Morley said
of Macaulay: &ldquo;Macaulay seeks truth, not as she should
be sought, devoutly, tentatively, with the air of one touching
the hem of a sacred garment, but clutching her by the
hair of the head and dragging her after him in a kind of
boisterous triumph, a prisoner of war and not a goddess.&rdquo;
It is, nevertheless, true that Macaulay and Buckle imparted
a new interest to history.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the impression we get of Macaulay
through reading his &ldquo;Life and Letters.&rdquo; Of Carlyle, in reading
the remarkable biography of him, we get the notion of a
great thinker as well as a great reader. He was not as keen
and diligent in the pursuit of material as Macaulay. He
did not like to work in libraries; he wanted every book he
used in his own study&mdash;padded as it was against the noises
which drove him wild. H.&nbsp;Morse Stephens relates that
Carlyle would not use a collection of documents relating to
the French Revolution in the British Museum for the reason
that the museum authorities would not have a private room
<a name="png.047" id="png.047"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>reserved for him where he might study. Rather than work
in a room with other people, he neglected this valuable
material. But Carlyle has certainly digested and used his
material well. His &ldquo;French Revolution&rdquo; seems to approach
the historical works of the classics in there being so much in
a little space. &ldquo;With the gift of song,&rdquo; Lowell said, &ldquo;Carlyle
would have been the greatest of epic poets since Homer;&rdquo;
and he also wrote, Carlyle&#8217;s historical compositions are no
more history than the historical plays of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The contention between the scientific historians and those
who hold to the old models is interesting and profitable.
One may enjoy the controversy and derive benefit from it
without taking sides. I suspect that there is truth in the
view of both. We may be sure that the long-continued study
and approval by scholars of many ages of the works of Herodotus,
Thucydides, and Tacitus implies historical merit on
their part in addition to literary art. It is, however, interesting
to note the profound difference between President
Woolsey&#8217;s opinion of Thucydides and that of some of his
late German critics. Woolsey said, &ldquo;I have such confidence
in the absolute truthfulness of Thucydides that were he
really chargeable with folly, as Grote alleges [in the affair of
Amphipolis], I believe he would have avowed it.&rdquo; On
the other hand, a German critic, cited by Holm, says that
Thucydides is a poet who invents facts partly in order to
teach people how things ought to be done and partly because
he liked to depict certain scenes of horror. He says
further, a narrative of certain occurrences is so full of impossibilities
that it must be pure invention on the part of the
historian. Another German maintains that Thucydides has
indulged in &ldquo;a fanciful and half-romantic picture of events.&rdquo;
But Holm, whom the scientific historians claim as one of
their own, says, &ldquo;Thucydides still remains a trustworthy
<a name="png.048" id="png.048"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>historical authority;&rdquo; and, &ldquo;On the whole, therefore, the old
view that he is a truthful writer is not in the least shaken.&rdquo;
Again Holm writes: &ldquo;Attempts have been made to convict
Thucydides of serious inaccuracies, but without success.
On the other hand, the writer of this work [that is, the scientific
historian, Holm] is able to state that he has followed
him topographically for the greater part of the sixth and
seventh books&mdash;and consequently for nearly one fourth
of the whole history&mdash;and has found that the more carefully
his words are weighed and the more accurately the
ground is studied the clearer both the text and events become,
and this is certainly high praise.&rdquo; Holm and Percy
Gardner, both of whom have the modern method and have
studied diligently the historical evidence from coins and
inscriptions, placed great reliance on Herodotus, who, as
well as Thucydides and Tacitus, is taken by scholars as a
model of historical composition.</p>

<p>The sifting of time settles the reputations of historians.
Of the English of the eighteenth century only one historian
has come down to us as worthy of serious study. Time is
wasted in reading Hume and Robertson as models, and no
one goes to them for facts. But thirty years ago no course
of historical reading was complete without Hume. In this
century the sifting process still goes on. One loses little by
not reading Alison&#8217;s &ldquo;History of Europe.&rdquo; But he was much
in vogue in the &#8217;50&#8217;s. <cite>Harper&#8217;s Magazine</cite> published a part of
his history as a serial. His rounded periods and bombastic
utterances were quoted with delight by those who thought
that history was not history unless it was bombastic. Emerson
says somewhere, &ldquo;Avoid adjectives; let your nouns do
the work.&rdquo; There was hardly a sentence in Alison which
did not traverse this rule. One of his admirers told me that
the great merit of his style was his choiceness and aptness
<a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in his use of adjectives. It is a style which now provokes
merriment, and even had Alison been learned and impartial,
and had he possessed a good method, his style for the present
taste would have killed his book. Gibbon is sometimes called
pompous, but place him by the side of Alison and what one
may have previously called pompousness one now calls
dignity.</p>

<p>Two of the literary historians of our century survive&mdash;Carlyle
and Macaulay. They may be read with care. We
may do as Cassius said Brutus did to him, observe all their
faults, set them in a note-book, learn and con them by rote;
nevertheless we shall get good from them. Oscar Browning
said&mdash;I am quoting H.&nbsp;Morse Stephens again&mdash;of Carlyle&#8217;s
description of the flight of the king to Varennes, that
in every one of his details where a writer could go wrong,
Carlyle had gone wrong; but added that, although all the
details were wrong, Carlyle&#8217;s account is essentially accurate.
No defense, I think, can be made of Carlyle&#8217;s statement that
Marat was a &ldquo;blear-eyed dog leach,&rdquo; nor of those statements
from which you get the distinct impression that the
complexion of Robespierre was green; nevertheless, every
one who studies the French Revolution reads Carlyle, and he
is read because the reading is profitable. The battle descriptions
in Carlyle&#8217;s &ldquo;Frederick the Great&rdquo; are well worth reading.
How refreshing they are after technical descriptions!
Carlyle said once, &ldquo;Battles since Homer&#8217;s time, when they
were nothing but fighting mobs, have ceased to be worth
reading about,&rdquo; but he made the modern battle interesting.</p>

<p>Macaulay is an honest partisan. You learn very soon how
to take him, and when distrust begins one has correctives
in Gardiner and Ranke. Froude is much more dangerous.
His splendid narrative style does not compensate for his
inaccuracies. Langlois makes an apt quotation from
<a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Froude. &ldquo;We saw,&rdquo; says Froude, of the city of Adelaide,
in Australia, &ldquo;below us in a basin, with the river winding
through it, a city of 150,000 inhabitants, none of whom has
ever known or ever will know one moment&#8217;s anxiety as to
the recurring regularity of three meals a day.&rdquo; Now for
the facts. Langlois says: &ldquo;Adelaide is built on an eminence;
no river runs through it. When Froude visited it
the population did not exceed 75,000, and it was suffering
from a famine at the time.&rdquo; Froude was curious in his inaccuracies.
He furnished the data which convict him of
error. He quoted inaccurately the Simancas manuscripts
and deposited correct copies in the British Museum. Carlyle
and Macaulay are honest partisans and you know how
to take them, but for constitutional inaccuracy such as
Froude&#8217;s no allowance can be made.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be said of Green that he combines
the merits of the scientific and literary historian. He has
written an honest and artistic piece of work. But he is
not infallible. I have been told on good authority that in
his reference to the Thirty Years&#8217; War he has hardly stated
a single fact correctly, yet the general impression you get
from his account is correct. Saintsbury writes that Green
has &ldquo;out-Macaulayed Macaulay in reckless abuse&rdquo; of Dryden.
Stubbs and Gardiner are preëminently the scientific
historians of England. Of Stubbs, from actual knowledge,
I regret that I cannot speak, but the reputation he has
among historical experts is positive proof of his great value.
Of Gardiner I can speak with knowledge. Any one who
desires to write history will do well to read every line Gardiner
has written&mdash;not the text alone, but also the notes.
It is an admirable study in method which will bear important
fruit. But because Gibbon, Gardiner, and Stubbs
should be one&#8217;s chief reliance, it does not follow that one may
<a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>neglect Macaulay, Carlyle, Tacitus, Thucydides, and Herodotus.
Gardiner himself has learned much from Macaulay
and Carlyle. All of them may be criticised on one point or
another, but they all have lessons for us.</p>

<p>We shall all agree that the aim of history is to get at the
truth and express it as clearly as possible. The differences
crop out when we begin to elaborate our meaning. &ldquo;This
I regard as the historian&#8217;s highest function,&rdquo; writes Tacitus,
&ldquo;to let no worthy action be uncommemorated, and to hold
out the reprobation of posterity as a terror to evil words
and deeds;&rdquo; while Langlois and the majority of the scholars
of Oxford are of the opinion that the formation and expression
of ethical judgments, the approval or condemnation of
Julius C&aelig;sar or of C&aelig;sar Borgia is not a thing within the
historian&#8217;s province. Let the controversy go on! It is
well worth one&#8217;s while to read the presentations of the subject
from the different points of view. But infallibility
will nowhere be found. Mommsen and Curtius in their detailed
investigations received applause from those who adhered
rigidly to the scientific view of history, but when they
addressed the public in their endeavor, it is said, to produce
an effect upon it, they relaxed their scientific rigor;
hence such a chapter as Curtius&#8217;s &ldquo;The years of peace,&rdquo; and
in another place his transmuting a conjecture of Grote into
an assertion; hence Mommsen&#8217;s effusive panegyric of C&aelig;sar.
If Mommsen did depart from the scientific rules, I suspect
that it came from no desire of a popular success, but rather
from the enthusiasm of much learning. The examples of
Curtius and Mommsen show probably that such a departure
from strict impartiality is inherent in the writing of general
history, and it comes, I take it, naturally and unconsciously.
Holm is a scientific historian, but on the Persian Invasion
he writes: &ldquo;I have followed Herodotus in many passages
<a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which are unauthenticated and probably even untrue, because
he reproduces the popular traditions of the Greeks.&rdquo;
And again: &ldquo;History in the main ought only to be a
record of facts, but now and then the historian may be
allowed to display a certain interest in his subject.&rdquo; These
expressions traverse the canons of scientific history as much
as the sayings of the ancient historiographers themselves.
But because men have warm sympathies that cause them
to color their narratives, shall no more general histories be
written? Shall history be confined to the printing of original
documents and to the publication of learned monographs
in which the discussion of authorities is mixed up with the
relation of events? The proper mental attitude of the
general historian is to take no thought of popularity. The
remark of Macaulay that he would make his history take the
place of the last novel on my lady&#8217;s table is not scientific.
The audience which the general historian should have in
mind is that of historical experts&mdash;men who are devoting
their lives to the study of history. Words of approval
from them are worth more than any popular recognition,
for theirs is the enduring praise. Their criticism should be
respected; there should be unceasing effort to avoid giving
them cause for fault-finding. No labor should be despised
which shall enable one to present things just as they are.
Our endeavor should be to think straight and see clear. An
incident should not be related on insufficient evidence because
it is interesting, but an affair well attested should not be discarded
because it happens to have a human interest. I feel
quite sure that the cardinal aim of Gardiner was to be accurate
and to proportion his story well. In this he has succeeded;
but it is no drawback that he has made his volumes
interesting. Jacob D. Cox, who added to other accomplishments
that of being learned in the law, and who looked upon
<a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Gardiner with such reverence that he called him the Chief
Justice, said there was no reason why he should read novels,
as he found Gardiner&#8217;s history more interesting than any
romance. The scientific historians have not revolutionized
historical methods, but they have added much. The process
of accretion has been going on since, at any rate, the
time of Herodotus, and the canons for weighing evidence
and the synthesis of materials are better understood now
than ever before, for they have been reduced from many
models. I feel sure that there has been a growth in candor.
Compare the critical note to a later edition which Macaulay
wrote in 1857, maintaining the truth of his charge against
William Penn, with the manly way in which Gardiner owns
up when an error or insufficient evidence for a statement is
pointed out. It is the ethics of the profession to be forward
in correcting errors. The difference between the old and the
new lies in the desire to have men think you are infallible
and the desire to be accurate.</p>

<h2><a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>THE PROFESSION OF HISTORIAN</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> assuming that among my audience there are some
students who aspire to become historians. To these especially
my discourse is addressed.</p>

<p>It is not to be expected that I should speak positively
and in detail on matters of education. Nevertheless, a man
of sixty who has devoted the better part of his life to reading,
observation, and reflection must have gained, if only through
a perception of his own deficiencies, some ideas that should
be useful to those who have, life&#8217;s experience before them.
Hence, if a Freshman should say to me, I wish to be a
historian, tell me what preliminary studies you would advise,
I should welcome the opportunity. From the nature
of the case, the history courses will be sought and studied in
their logical order and my advice will have to do only with
collateral branches of learning.</p>

<p>In the first place, I esteem a knowledge of Latin and French
of the highest importance. By a knowledge of French, I mean
that you should be able to read it substantially as well as you
read English, so that when you have recourse to a dictionary
it will be a French dictionary and not one of the French-English
kind. The historical and other literature that is thus
opened up to you enables you to live in another world, with
a point of view impossible to one who reads for pleasure only
in his own tongue. To take two instances: Molière is a
complement to Shakespeare, and the man who knows his
Molière as he does his Shakespeare has made a propitious
<a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>beginning in that study of human character which must be
understood if he desires to write a history that shall gain
readers. &ldquo;I have known and loved Molière,&rdquo; said Goethe,
&ldquo;from my youth and have learned from him during my
whole life. I never fail to read some of his plays every year,
that I may keep up a constant intercourse with what is excellent.
It is not merely the perfectly artistic treatment
which delights me; but particularly the amiable nature, the
highly formed mind of the poet. There is in him a grace
and a feeling for the decorous, and a tone of good society,
which his innate beautiful nature could only attain by
daily intercourse with the most eminent men of his
 age.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.1" name="fna.iii.1" id="fna.iii.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>My other instance is Balzac. In reading him for pleasure,
as you read Dickens and Thackeray, you are absorbing an
exact and fruitful knowledge of French society of the Restoration
and of Louis Philippe. Moreover you are still
pursuing your study of human character under one of the
acute critics of the nineteenth century. Balzac has always
seemed to me peculiarly French, his characters belong
essentially to Paris or to the provinces. I associate Eugénie
Grandet with Saumur in the Touraine and César Birotteau
with the Rue St. Honoré in Paris; and all his other men and
women move naturally in the great city or in the provinces
which he has given them for their home. A devoted
admirer however tells me that in his opinion Balzac has
created universal types; the counterpart of some of his men
may be seen in the business and social world of Boston, and
the peculiarly sharp and dishonest transaction which
brought César Birotteau to financial ruin was here exactly
reproduced.</p>

<p>The French language and literature seem to possess the
merits which ours lack; and the writer of history cannot
<a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>afford to miss the lessons he will receive by a constant reading
of the best French prose.</p>

<p>I do not ask the Freshman who is going to be a historian
to realize Macaulay&#8217;s ideal of a scholar, to &ldquo;read Plato with
his feet on the fender,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.2" name="fna.iii.2" id="fna.iii.2">2</a></sup>
 but he should at least acquire a
pretty thorough knowledge of classical Latin, so that he can
read Latin, let me say, as many of us read German, that is
with the use of a lexicon and the occasional translation of a
sentence or a paragraph into English to arrive at its exact
meaning. Of this, I can speak from the point of view of one
who is deficient. The reading of Latin has been for me a
grinding labor and I would have liked to read with pleasure
in the original, the History and Annals of Tacitus, C&aelig;sar&#8217;s
Gallic and Civil wars and Cicero&#8217;s Orations and Private
Letters even to the point of following Macaulay&#8217;s
advice, &ldquo;Soak your mind with Cicero.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.2">2</a></sup>
 These would have
given me, I fancy, a more vivid impression of two periods
of Roman history than I now possess. Ferrero, who is imparting
a fresh interest to the last period of the Roman republic,
owes a part of his success, I think, to his thorough
digestion and effective use of Cicero&#8217;s letters, which have the
faculty of making one acquainted with Cicero just as if he
were a modern man. During a sojourn on the shores of
Lake Geneva, I read two volumes of Voltaire&#8217;s private correspondence,
and later, while passing the winter in Rome,
the four volumes of Cicero&#8217;s letters in French. I could not
help thinking that in the republic of letters one was not in
time at a far greater distance from Cicero than from Voltaire.
While the impression of nearness may have come from
reading both series of letters in French, or because, to use
John Morley&#8217;s words, &ldquo;two of the most perfect masters
of the art of letter writing were Cicero and
 Voltaire,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.3" name="fna.iii.3" id="fna.iii.3">3</a></sup>
<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">52</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>there is a decided flavor of the nineteenth century in Cicero&#8217;s
words to a good liver whom he is going to visit. &ldquo;You
must not reckon,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;on my eating your hors
d&#8217;&oelig;uvre. I have given them up entirely. The time has
gone by when I can abuse my stomach with your olives and
your Lucanian sausages.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.4"
 name="fna.iii.4" id="fna.iii.4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>To repeat then, if the student, who is going to be a historian,
uses his acquisitive years in obtaining a thorough
knowledge of French and Latin, he will afterwards be spared
useless regrets. He will naturally add German for the purpose
of general culture and, if languages come easy, perhaps
Greek. &ldquo;Who is not acquainted with another language,&rdquo;
said Goethe, &ldquo;knows not his own.&rdquo; A thorough knowledge
of Latin and French is a long stride towards an efficient
mastery of English. In the matter of diction, the
English writer is rarely in doubt as to words of Anglo-Saxon
origin, for these are deep-rooted in his childhood and his
choice is generally instinctive. The difficulties most persistently
besetting him concern words that come from the
Latin or the French; and here he must use reason or the
dictionary or both. The author who has a thorough knowledge
of Latin and French will argue with himself as to the
correct diction, will follow Emerson&#8217;s advice, &ldquo;Know words
etymologically; pull them apart; see how they are made;
and use them only where they fit.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.5"
 name="fna.iii.5" id="fna.iii.5">5</a></sup> As it is in action
through life, so it is in writing; the conclusions arrived at by
reason are apt to be more valuable than those which we
accept on authority. The reasoned literary style is more
virile than that based on the dictionary. A judgment arrived
at by argument sticks in the memory, while it is necessary
for the user of the dictionary constantly to invoke
authority, so that the writer who reasons out the meaning
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of words may constantly accelerate his pace, for the doubt
and decision of yesterday is to-day a solid acquirement, ingrained
in his mental being. I have lately been reading a
good deal of Gibbon and I cannot imagine his having had
frequent recourse to a dictionary. I do not remember even
an allusion either in his autobiographies or in his private
letters to any such aid. Undoubtedly his thorough knowledge
of Latin and French, his vast reading of Latin, French,
and English books, enabled him to dispense with the thumbing
of a dictionary and there was probably a reasoning
process at the back of every important word. It is difficult,
if not impossible, to improve on Gibbon by the substitution
of one word for another.</p>

<p>A rather large reading of Sainte-Beuve gives me the same
impression. Indeed his literary fecundity, the necessity of
having the Causerie ready for each Monday&#8217;s issue of the
<cite>Constitutionnel</cite> or the <cite>Moniteur</cite>, precluded a study of words
while composing, and his rapid and correct writing was undoubtedly
due to the training obtained by the process of
reasoning. Charles Sumner seems to be an exception to
my general rule. Although presumably he knew Latin
well, he was a slave to dictionaries. He generally had five
at his elbow (Johnson, Webster, Worcester, Walker, and
Pickering) and when in doubt as to the use of a word he
consulted all five and let the matter be decided on the American
democratic principle of majority rule.<sup><a href="#fn.iii.6"
 name="fna.iii.6" id="fna.iii.6">6</a></sup> Perhaps this
is one cause of the stilted and artificial character of Sumner&#8217;s
speeches which, unlike Daniel Webster&#8217;s, are not to be thought
of as literature. One does not associate dictionaries with
Webster. Thus had I written the sentence without thinking
of a not infrequent confusion between Noah and Daniel
Webster, and this confusion reminded me of a story which
<a name="png.062" id="png.062"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">54</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>John Fiske used to tell with gusto and which some of you
may not have heard. An English gentleman remarked to an
American: &ldquo;What a giant intellect that Webster of yours
had! To think of so great an orator and statesman writing
that dictionary! But I felt sure that one who towered so
much above his fellows would come to a bad end and I was
not a bit surprised to learn that he had been hanged for the
murder of Dr. Parkman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To return to my theme: One does not associate dictionaries
with Daniel Webster. He was given to preparing
his speeches in the solitudes of nature, and his first Bunker
Hill oration, delivered in 1825, was mainly composed while
wading in a trout stream and desultorily fishing for trout.<sup><a href="#fn.iii.7"
 name="fna.iii.7" id="fna.iii.7">7</a></sup>
Joe Jefferson, who loved fishing as well as Webster, used to
say, &ldquo;The trout is a gentleman and must be treated as such.&rdquo;
Webster&#8217;s companion might have believed that some such
thought as this was passing through the mind of the great
Daniel as, standing middle deep in the stream, he uttered
these sonorous words: &ldquo;Venerable men! You have come down
to us from a former generation. Heaven has bounteously
lengthened out your lives that you might behold this joyous
day.&rdquo; I think Daniel Webster for the most part reasoned
out his choice of words; he left the dictionary work to
others. After delivery, he threw down the manuscript of
his eulogy on Adams and Jefferson and said to a student in
his law office, &ldquo;There, Tom, please to take that discourse and
weed out the Latin words.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.8"
 name="fna.iii.8" id="fna.iii.8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>When doubtful as to the use of words, I should have been
helped by a better knowledge of Latin and enabled very often
to write with a surer touch. Though compelled to resort
frequently to the dictionary, I early learned to pay little
attention to the definition but to regard with care the illustrative
<a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]
 </span> meaning in the citations from standard authors.
When I began writing I used the Imperial Dictionary, an
improvement over Webster in this respect. Soon the Century
Dictionary began to appear, and best of all the New
English Dictionary on historical principles edited by Murray
and Bradley and published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford.
A study of the mass of quotations in these two dictionaries
undoubtedly does much to atone for the lack of
linguistic knowledge; and the tracing of the history of words,
as it is done in the Oxford dictionary, makes any inquiry as
to the meaning of a word fascinating work for the historian.
Amongst the multiplicity of aids for the student and the
writer no single one is so serviceable as this product of labor
and self-sacrifice, fostered by the Clarendon Press, to whom,
all writers in the English language owe a debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>Macaulay had a large fund of knowledge on which he
might base his reasoning, and his indefatigable mind welcomed
any outside assistance. He knew Greek and Latin
thoroughly and a number of other languages, but it is related
of him that he so thumbed his copy of Johnson&#8217;s Dictionary
that he was continually sending it to the binder. In return
for his mastery of the languages, the dictionaries are fond of
quoting Macaulay. If I may depend upon a rough mental
computation, no prose writer of the nineteenth century is
so frequently cited. &ldquo;He never wrote an obscure sentence
in his life,&rdquo; said John Morley;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.9"
 name="fna.iii.9" id="fna.iii.9">9</a></sup> and this is partly due to his
exact use of words. There is never any doubt about his
meaning. Macaulay began the use of Latin words at an
early age. When four and a half years old he was asked if
he had got over the toothache, to which question came
this reply, &ldquo;The agony is abated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mathematics beyond arithmetic are of no use to the
<a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>historian and may be entirely discarded. I do not ignore John
Stuart Mill&#8217;s able plea for them, some words of which are
worth quoting. &ldquo;Mathematical studies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are of
immense benefit to the student&#8217;s education by habituating
him to precision. It is one of the peculiar excellences of
mathematical discipline that the mathematician is never

The practice of mathematical reasoning gives wariness of
the mind; it accustoms us to demand a sure footing.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.10"

Mill, however, is no guide except for exceptionally gifted
youth. He began to learn Greek when he was three years
old, and by the time he had reached the age of twelve had
read a good part of Latin and Greek literature and knew
elementary geometry and algebra thoroughly.</p>

<p>The three English historians who have most influenced
thought from 1776 to 1900 are those whom John Morley
called &ldquo;great born men of letters&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.11"
 name="fna.iii.11" id="fna.iii.11">11</a></sup>&mdash;Gibbon, Macaulay, and
Carlyle; and two of these despised mathematics. &ldquo;As soon
as I understood the principles,&rdquo; wrote Gibbon in his &ldquo;Autobiography,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I relinquished forever the pursuit of the Mathematics;
nor can I lament that I desisted before my mind
was hardened by the habit of rigid demonstration, so destructive
of the finer feelings of moral evidence, which must
however determine the actions and opinions of our lives.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.12"
 name="fna.iii.12" id="fna.iii.12">12</a></sup>
Macaulay, while a student at Cambridge, wrote to his mother:
&ldquo;Oh, for words to express my abomination of mathematics &hellip; &lsquo;Discipline&rsquo;
of the mind! Say rather starvation, confinement,
torture, annihilation!&hellip; I feel myself becoming
a personification of Algebra, a living trigonometrical
canon, a walking table of logarithms. All my perceptions
of elegance and beauty gone, or at least going&hellip;. Farewell
<a name="png.065" id="png.065"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>then Homer and Sophocles and Cicero.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.13"
 name="fna.iii.13" id="fna.iii.13">13</a></sup> I must in
fairness state that in after life Macaulay regretted his lack of
knowledge of mathematics and physics, but his career and
Gibbon&#8217;s demonstrate that mathematics need have no place
on the list of the historian&#8217;s studies. Carlyle, however,
showed mathematical ability which attracted the attention
of Legendre and deemed himself sufficiently qualified to
apply, when he was thirty-nine years old, for the professorship
of Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh. He did
not succeed in obtaining the post but, had he done so, he
&ldquo;would have made,&rdquo; so Froude his biographer thinks, &ldquo;the
school of Astronomy at Edinburgh famous throughout Europe.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.14"
 name="fna.iii.14" id="fna.iii.14">14</a></sup>
When fifty-two, Carlyle said that &ldquo;the man who
had mastered the first forty-seven propositions of Euclid
stood nearer to God than he had done before.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.15"
 name="fna.iii.15" id="fna.iii.15">15</a></sup> I may cap
this with some words of Emerson, who in much of his
thought resembled Carlyle: &ldquo;What hours of melancholy
my mathematical works cost! It was long before I learned
that there is something wrong with a man&#8217;s brain who loves
them.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.16"
 name="fna.iii.16" id="fna.iii.16">16</a></sup></p>

<p>Mathematics are of course the basis of many studies,
trades, and professions and are sometimes of benefit as a
recreation for men of affairs. Devotion to Euclid undoubtedly
added to Lincoln&#8217;s strength, but the necessary range
of knowledge for the historian is so vast that he cannot spend
his evenings and restless nights in the solution of mathematical
problems. In short, mathematics are of no more
use to him than is Greek to the civil or mechanical engineer.</p>

<p>In the category with mathematics must be placed a detailed
study of any of the physical or natural sciences. I
think that a student during his college course should have
<a name="png.066" id="png.066"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a year&#8217;s work in a chemical laboratory or else, if his taste
inclines him to botany, geology, or zoölogy, a year&#8217;s training
of his observing powers in some one of these studies. For he
ought to get, while at an impressible age, a superficial knowledge
of the methods of scientific men, as a basis for his future
reading. We all know that science is moving the world
and to keep abreast with the movement is a necessity for
every educated man. Happily, there are scientific men who
popularize their knowledge. John Fiske, Huxley, and Tyndall
presented to us the theories and demonstrations of science
in a literary style that makes learning attractive. Huxley
and Tyndall were workers in laboratories and gave us the
results of their patient and long-continued experiments. It
is too much to expect that every generation will produce
men of the remarkable power of expression of Huxley and
John Fiske, but there will always be clear writers who will
delight in instructing the general public in language easily
understood. In an address which I delivered eight or nine
years ago before the American Historical Association, I
cheerfully conceded that, in the realm of intellectual endeavor,
the natural and physical sciences should have the
precedence of history. The question with us now is not
which is the nobler pursuit, but how is the greatest economy
of time to be compassed for the historian. My advice is in
the line of concentration. Failure in life arises frequently
from intellectual scattering; hence I like to see the historical
student getting his physical and natural science at second-hand.</p>

<p>The religious and political revolutions of the last four
hundred years have weakened authority; but in intellectual
development I believe that in general an important
advantage lies in accepting the dicta of specialists. In this
respect our scientific men may teach us a lesson. One not
<a name="png.067" id="png.067"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>infrequently meets a naturalist or a physician, who possesses
an excellent knowledge of history, acquired by reading the
works of general historians who have told an interesting
story. He would laugh at the idea that he must verify the
notes of his author and read the original documents, for he
has confidence that the interpretation is accurate and truthful.
This is all that I ask of the would-be historian. For
the sake of going to the bottom of things in his own special
study, let him take his physical and natural science on trust
and he may well begin to do this during his college course.
As a manner of doing this, there occur to me three interesting
biographies, the Life of Darwin, the Life of Huxley,
and the Life of Pasteur, which give the important part of
the story of scientific development during the last half of
the nineteenth century. Now I believe that a thorough
mastery of these three books will be worth more to the
historical student than any driblets of science that he may
pick up in an unsystematic college course.</p>

<p>With this elimination of undesirable studies&mdash;undesirable
because of lack of time&mdash;there remains ample time for those
studies which are necessary for the equipment of a historian;
to wit, languages, histories, English, French, and Latin literature,
and as much of economics as his experienced teachers
advise. Let him also study the fine arts as well as he can in
America, fitting himself for an appreciation of the great works
of architecture, sculpture, and painting in Europe which he
will recognize as landmarks of history in their potent influence
on the civilization of mankind. Let us suppose that
our hypothetical student has marked out on these lines his
college course of four years, and his graduate course of three.
At the age of twenty-five he will then have received an
excellent college education. The university with its learned
and hard-working teachers, its wealth, its varied and wholesome
<a name="png.068" id="png.068"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>traditions has done for him the utmost possible.
Henceforward his education must depend upon himself
and, unless he has an insatiable love of reading, he had better
abandon the idea of becoming a historian; for books, pamphlets,
old newspapers, and manuscripts are the stock of his
profession and to them he must show a single-minded devotion.
He must love his library as Pasteur did his laboratory
and must fill with delight most of the hours of the day
in reading or writing. To this necessity there is no alternative.
Whether it be in general preparation or in the
detailed study of a special period, there is no end to the material
which may be read with advantage. The young man
of twenty-five can do no better than to devote five years of
his life to general preparation. And what enjoyment he
has before him! He may draw upon a large mass of histories
and biographies, of books of correspondence, of poems,
plays, and novels; it is then for him to select with discrimination,
choosing the most valuable, as they afford
him facts, augment his knowledge of human nature, and
teach him method and expression. &ldquo;A good book,&rdquo; said
Milton, &ldquo;is the precious life blood of a master spirit,&rdquo;
and every good book which wins our student&#8217;s interest
and which he reads carefully will help him directly or
indirectly in his career. And there are some books which
he will wish to master, as if he were to be subjected
to an examination on them. As to these he will be guided
by strong inclination and possibly with a view to the subject
of his magnum opus; but if these considerations be
absent and if the work has not been done in the university,
I cannot too strongly recommend the mastery of Gibbon&#8217;s
&ldquo;Decline and Fall&rdquo; and Bryce&#8217;s &ldquo;Holy Roman Empire.&rdquo;
Gibbon merits close study because his is undoubtedly the
greatest history of modern times and because it is, in the
<a name="png.069" id="png.069"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>words of Carlyle, a splendid bridge from the old world to the
new. He should be read in the edition of Bury, whose
scholarly introduction gives a careful and just estimate of
Gibbon and whose notes show the results of the latest researches.
This edition does not include Guizot&#8217;s and Milman&#8217;s
notes, which seem to an old-fashioned reader of Gibbon
like myself worthy of attention, especially those on the
famous Fifteenth and Sixteenth Chapters. Bryce&#8217;s &ldquo;Holy
Roman Empire&rdquo; is a fitting complement to Gibbon, and the
intellectual possession of the two is an education in itself
which will be useful in the study of any period of history that
may be chosen.</p>

<p>The student who reads Gibbon will doubtless be influenced
by his many tributes to Tacitus and will master the Roman
historian. I shall let Macaulay furnish the warrant for a
close study of Thucydides. &ldquo;This day,&rdquo; Macaulay said,
when in his thirty-fifth year, &ldquo;I finished Thucydides after
reading him with inexpressible interest and admiration.
He is the greatest historian that ever lived.&rdquo; Again during
the same year he wrote: &ldquo;What are all the Roman historians
to the great Athenian? I do assure you there is no prose
composition in the world, not even the oration on the Crown,
which I place so high as the seventh book of Thucydides.
It is the <em>ne plus ultra</em> of human art. I was delighted to find
in Gray&#8217;s letters the other day this query to Wharton: &lsquo;The
retreat from Syracuse&mdash;is or is it not the finest thing you
ever read in your life?&rsquo; &hellip; Most people read all the
Greek they ever read before they are five and twenty.
They never find time for such studies afterwards until
they are in the decline of life; and then their knowledge of
the language is in great measure lost, and cannot easily be
recovered. Accordingly, almost all the ideas that people
have of Greek literature are ideas formed while they were
<a name="png.070" id="png.070"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>still very young. A young man, whatever his genius may
be, is no judge of such a writer as Thucydides. I had no
high opinion of him ten years ago. I have now been reading
him with a mind accustomed to historical researches and
to political affairs and I am astonished at my own former
blindness and at his greatness.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.17"
 name="fna.iii.17" id="fna.iii.17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>I have borrowed John Morley&#8217;s words, speaking of Gibbon,
Macaulay, and Carlyle as &ldquo;three great born men of letters.&rdquo;
Our student cannot therefore afford to miss a knowledge of
Macaulay&#8217;s History, but the Essays, except perhaps three
or four of the latest ones, need not be read. In a preface
to the authorized edition of the Essays, Macaulay wrote
that he was &ldquo;sensible of their defects,&rdquo; deemed them &ldquo;imperfect
pieces,&rdquo; and did not think that they were &ldquo;worthy of a
permanent place in English literature.&rdquo; For instance, his
essay on Milton contained scarcely a paragraph which his
matured judgment approved. Macaulay&#8217;s peculiar faults
are emphasized in his Essays and much of the harsh criticism
which he has received comes from the glaring defects of
these earlier productions. His history, however, is a great
book, shows extensive research, a sane method and an excellent
power of narration; and when he is a partisan, he is
so honest and transparent that the effect of his partiality
is neither enduring nor mischievous.</p>

<p>I must say further to the student: read either Carlyle&#8217;s
&ldquo;French Revolution&rdquo; or his &ldquo;Frederick the Great,&rdquo; I
care not which, although it is well worth one&#8217;s while to
read both. If your friends who maintain that history
is a science convince you that the &ldquo;French Revolution&rdquo;
is not history, as perhaps they may, read it as a narrative
poem. Truly Carlyle spoke rather like a poet than
a historian when he wrote to his wife (in his forty-first
<a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>year): &ldquo;A hundred pages more and this cursed book is flung
out of me. I mean to write with force of fire till that consummation;
above all with the speed of fire&hellip;. It all
stands pretty fair in my head, nor do I mean to investigate
much more about it, but to splash down what I know in
large masses of colors, that it may look like a smoke-and-flame
conflagration in the distance, which it is.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.18"
 name="fna.iii.18" id="fna.iii.18">18</a></sup> It was
Carlyle&#8217;s custom to work all of the morning and take a solitary
walk in Hyde Park in the afternoon, when looking upon
the gay scene, the display of wealth and fashion, &ldquo;seeing,&rdquo;
as he said, &ldquo;all the carriages dash hither and thither and so
many human bipeds cheerily hurrying along,&rdquo; he said to
himself: &ldquo;There you go, brothers, in your gilt carriages and
prosperities, better or worse, and make an extreme bother
and confusion, the devil very largely in it&hellip;. Not one
of you could do what I am doing, and it concerns you too,
if you did but know it.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.19"
 name="fna.iii.19" id="fna.iii.19">19</a></sup> When the book was done he
wrote to his brother, &ldquo;It is a wild, savage book, itself a kind
of French Revolution.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.20"
 name="fna.iii.20" id="fna.iii.20">20</a></sup> From its somewhat obscure style
it requires a slow perusal and careful study, but this serves
all the more to fix it in the memory causing it to remain an
abiding influence.</p>

<p>There are eight volumes of &ldquo;Frederick the Great,&rdquo; containing,
according to Barrett Wendell&#8217;s computation, over one
million words; and this eighteenth-century tale, with its large
number of great and little characters, its &ldquo;mass of living
facts&rdquo; impressed Wendell chiefly with its unity. &ldquo;Whatever
else Carlyle was,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;the unity of this enormous
book proves him, when he chose to be, a Titanic artist.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.21"
 name="fna.iii.21" id="fna.iii.21">21</a></sup>
Only those who have striven for unity in a narrative can
appreciate the tribute contained in these words. It was a
<a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>struggle, too, for Carlyle. Fifty-six years old when he conceived
the idea of Frederick, his nervousness and irritability
were a constant torment to himself and his devoted wife.
Many entries in his journal tell of his &ldquo;dismal continual
wrestle with Friedrich,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.22"
 name="fna.iii.22" id="fna.iii.22">22</a></sup> perhaps the most characteristic
of which is this: &ldquo;My Frederick looks as if it would never
take shape in me; in fact the problem is to burn away the
immense dungheap of the eighteenth century, with its ghastly
cants, foul, blind sensualities, cruelties, and <em>inanity</em> now
fallen <em>putrid</em>, rotting inevitably towards annihilation; to
destroy and extinguish all that, having got to know it, and
to know that it must be rejected for evermore; after which
the perennial portion, pretty much Friedrich and Voltaire
so far as I can see, may remain conspicuous and capable of
being delineated.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.23"
 name="fna.iii.23" id="fna.iii.23">23</a></sup></p>

<p>The student, who has become acquainted with the works
of Gibbon, Macaulay, and Carlyle, will wish to know something
of the men themselves and this curiosity may be easily
and delightfully gratified. The autobiographies of Gibbon,
the Life of Macaulay by Sir George Trevelyan, the History
of Carlyle&#8217;s Life by Froude, present the personality of these
historians in a vivid manner. Gibbon has himself told of
all his own faults and Froude has omitted none of Carlyle&#8217;s,
so that these two books are useful aids in a study of human
nature, in which respect they are real adjuncts of Boswell&#8217;s
Johnson. Gibbon, Carlyle, and Macaulay had an insatiable
love of reading; in their solitary hours they were seldom
without books in their hands. Valuable instruction may be
derived from a study of their lives from their suggestions of
books, helpful in the development of a historian. They
knew how to employ their odd moments, and Gibbon and
Macaulay were adepts in the art of desultory reading. Sainte-Beuve
<a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>makes a plea for desultory reading in instancing
Tocqueville&#8217;s lack of it, so that he failed to illustrate and
animate his pages with its fruits, the result being, in the long
run, great monotony.<sup><a href="#fn.iii.24"
 name="fna.iii.24" id="fna.iii.24">24</a></sup> As a relief to the tired brain, without
a complete loss of time, the reading at hazard, even browsing
in a library, has its place in the equipment of a historian.
One of the most striking examples of self-education in
literature is Carlyle&#8217;s seven years, from the age of thirty-two
to thirty-nine, passed at Craigenputtock where his native inclination
was enforced by his physical surroundings. Craigenputtock,
wrote Froude, is &ldquo;the dreariest spot in all the British
dominions. The nearest cottage is more than a mile from
it; the elevation, 700 feet above the sea, stunts the trees and
limits the garden produce to the hardiest vegetables. The
house is gaunt and hungry-looking.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.25"
 name="fna.iii.25" id="fna.iii.25">25</a></sup> The place realized
Tennyson&#8217;s words, &ldquo;O, the dreary, dreary moorland.&rdquo;
Here Carlyle read books, gave himself over to silent meditation,
and wrote for his bread, although a man who possessed
an adequate income could not have been more independent
in thought than he was, or more averse to writing to the
order of editors of reviews and magazines. With no outside
distractions, books were his companions as well as
his friends. As you read Froude&#8217;s intimate biography, it
comes upon you, as you consider Carlyle&#8217;s life in London,
what a tremendous intellectual stride he had made while
living in this dreary solitude of Craigenputtock. It was
there that he continued his development under the intellectual
influence of Goethe, wrote &ldquo;Sartor Resartus&rdquo; and conceived
the idea of writing the story of the French Revolution.
Those seven years, as you trace their influence during the
rest of his life, will ever be a tribute to the concentrated,
bookish labors of bookish men.</p>

<p><a name="png.074" id="png.074"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>It is often said that some practical experience in life is
necessary for the training of a historian; that only thus can
he arrive at a knowledge of human nature and become a
judge of character; that, while the theory is occasionally
advanced that history is a series of movements which may
be described without taking individuals into account, as a
matter of fact, one cannot go far on this hypothesis without
running up against the truth that movements have motors
and the motors are men. Hence we are to believe the
dictum that the historian needs that knowledge of men
which is to be obtained only by practical dealings with them.
It is true that Gibbon&#8217;s service in the Hampshire militia
and his membership in the House of Commons were of benefit
to the historian of the Roman Empire. Grote&#8217;s business
life, Macaulay&#8217;s administrative work in India, and the parliamentary
experience of both were undoubtedly of value to
their work as historians, but there are excellent historians
who have never had any such training. Carlyle is an example,
and Samuel R. Gardiner is another. Curiously
enough, Gardiner, who was a pure product of the university
and the library, has expressed sounder judgments on many
of the prominent men of the seventeenth century than Macaulay.
I am not aware that there is in historical literature
any other such striking contrast as this, for it is difficult to
draw the line closely between the historian and the man of
affairs, but Gardiner&#8217;s example is strengthened in other historians&#8217;
lives sufficiently to warrant the statement that the
historian need not be a man of the world. Books are written
by men and treat of the thoughts and actions of men and
a good study may be made of human character without going
beyond the walls of a library.</p>

<p>Drawing upon my individual experience again I feel that
the two authors who have helped me most in this study of
<a name="png.075" id="png.075"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>human character are Shakespeare and Homer. I do not
mean that in the modern world we meet Hamlet, Iago, Macbeth,
and Shylock, but when we perceive &ldquo;the native hue of
resolution sicklied o&#8217;er with the pale cast of thought,&rdquo; when
we come in contact with the treachery of a seeming friend,
with unholy ambition and insensate greed, we are better
able to interpret them on the page of history from having
grasped the lessons of Shakespeare to mankind. A constant
reading of Shakespeare will show us unchanging passions
and feelings; and we need not make literal contrasts, as did
the British matron who remarked of &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra&rdquo;
that it was &ldquo;so unlike the home life of our beloved
queen.&rdquo; Bernard Shaw, who has said much in detraction
of Shakespeare, writes in one of his admiring moods, &ldquo;that
the imaginary scenes and people he has created become more
real to us than our actual life&mdash;at least until our knowledge
and grip of actual life begins to deepen and glow beyond
the common. When I was twenty,&rdquo; Shaw continues, &ldquo;I
knew everybody in Shakespeare from Hamlet to Abhorson,
much more intimately than I knew my living contemporaries;
and to this day, if the name of Pistol or Polonius
catches my eye in a newspaper, I turn to the passage with
curiosity.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.26"
 name="fna.iii.26" id="fna.iii.26">26</a></sup></p>

<p>Homer&#8217;s character of Ulysses is a link between the ancient
and the modern world. One feels that Ulysses would be at
home in the twentieth century and would adapt himself to
the conditions of modern political life. Perhaps, indeed, he
would have preferred to his militant age our industrial one
where prizes are often won by craft and persuasive eloquence
rather than by strength of arm. The story of Ulysses is a
signal lesson in the study of human character, and receives
a luminous commentary in Shakespeare&#8217;s adaptation of it.
<a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>The advice which Ulysses gives to Achilles<sup><a href="#fn.iii.27"
 name="fna.iii.27" id="fna.iii.27">27</a></sup> is a piece of
worldly wisdom and may well be acted on by those who
desire advancement in life and are little scrupulous in regard
to means. The first part of Goethe&#8217;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; is another book
which has profoundly affected my view of life. I read it
first when seventeen years old and have continually re-read
it; and, while I fail to comprehend it wholly, and, although
it does not give me the same kind of knowledge of human
character that I derive from Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, I carry
away from it abiding impressions from the contact that it
affords with one of the greatest of human minds.</p>

<p>All this counsel of mine, as to the reading of the embryo
historian is, of course, merely supplementary, and does not
pretend to be exhaustive. I am assuming that during his
undergraduate and graduate course the student has been
advised to read, either wholly or in part, most of the English,
German, and French scientific historians of the past
fifty years, and that he has become acquainted in a greater
or less degree with all the eminent American historians. My
own experience has been that a thorough knowledge of one
book of an author is better than a superficial acquaintance
with all of his works. The only book of Francis Parkman&#8217;s
which I have read is his &ldquo;Montcalm and Wolfe,&rdquo; parts of
which I have gone over again and again. One chapter, pervaded
with the scenery of the place, I have read on Lake
George, three others more than once at Quebec, and I feel
that I know Parkman&#8217;s method as well as if I had skimmed
all his volumes. But I believe I was careful in my selection,
for in his own estimation, and in that of the general public,
&ldquo;Montcalm and Wolfe&rdquo; is his best work. So with Motley,
<a name="png.077" id="png.077"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>I have read nothing but the &ldquo;Dutch Republic,&rdquo; but that I
have read through twice carefully. I will not say that it is
the most accurate of his works, but it is probably the most
interesting and shows his graphic and dashing style at its
best. An admirer of Stubbs told me that his &ldquo;Lectures and
Addresses on Medi&aelig;val and Modern History&rdquo; would give me
a good idea of his scholarship and literary manner and that
I need not tackle his magnum opus. But those lectures
gave me a taste for more and, undeterred by the remark of
still another admirer that nobody ever read his &ldquo;Constitutional
History&rdquo; through, I did read one volume with
interest and profit, and I hope at some future time to read
the other two. On the other hand, I have read everything
that Samuel R. Gardiner has written except &ldquo;What Gunpowder
Plot Was.&rdquo; Readers differ. There are fast readers
who have the faculty of getting just what they want out of
a book in a brief time and they retain the thing which they
have sought. Assuredly I envy men that power. For myself,
I have never found any royal road to learning, have
been a slow reader, and needed a re-reading, sometimes
more than one, to acquire any degree of mastery of a book.
Macaulay used to read his favorite Greek and Latin classics
over and over again and presumably always with care, but
modern books he turned off with extraordinary speed. Of
Buckle&#8217;s large volume of the &ldquo;History of Civilization&rdquo;
Macaulay wrote in his journal: &ldquo;I read Buckle&#8217;s book all
day, and got to the end, skipping, of course. A man of
talent and of a good deal of reading, but paradoxical and
incoherent.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.28"
 name="fna.iii.28" id="fna.iii.28">28</a></sup> John Fiske, I believe, was a slow reader, but
he had such a remarkable power of concentration that what
he read once was his own. Of this I can give a notable instance.
At a meeting in Boston a number of years ago of the
<a name="png.078" id="png.078"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Military Historical Society of Massachusetts, Colonel William
R. Livermore read a learned and interesting paper on Napoleon&#8217;s
Campaigns in Northern Italy, and a few men, among
whom were Fiske and John C. Ropes, remained after supper
to discuss the paper. The discussion went well into details
and was technical. Fiske had as much to say as any one
and met the military critics on their own ground, holding
his own in this interchange of expert opinions. As we returned
to Cambridge together, I expressed my surprise at his
wide technical knowledge. &ldquo;It is all due to one book,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;A few summers ago I had occasion to read Sir
Edward Hamley&#8217;s &lsquo;Operations of War&rsquo; and for some reason
or other everything in it seemed to sink into my mind and
to be there retained, ready for use, as was the case to-night
with his references to the Northern Italian campaigns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside of ordinary historical reading, a book occurs to
me which is well worth a historian&#8217;s mastery. I am assuming
that our hypothetical student has read Goethe&#8217;s
&ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; &ldquo;Werther,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wilhelm Meister,&rdquo; and desires
to know something of the personality of this great writer.
He should, therefore, read Eckermann&#8217;s &ldquo;Conversations
with Goethe,&rdquo; in which he will find a body of profitable
literary criticism, given out in a familiar way by the most
celebrated man then living. The talks began when he was
seventy-three and continued until near his death, ten years
later; they reveal his maturity of judgment. Greek, Roman,
German, English, French, Spanish, and Italian authors
are taken up from time to time and discussed with clearness
and appreciation, running sometimes to enthusiasm. As a
guide to the best reading extant up to 1832 I know nothing
better. Eckermann is inferior as a biographer to Boswell,
and his book is neither so interesting nor amusing; but
Goethe was far greater than Johnson, and his talk is
<a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>cosmopolitan and broad, while Johnson&#8217;s is apt to be insular and
narrow. &ldquo;One should not study contemporaries and competitors,&rdquo;
Goethe said, &ldquo;but the great men of antiquity,
whose works have for centuries received equal homage and
consideration&hellip;. Let us study Molière, let us study
Shakespeare, but above all things, the old Greeks and always
the Greeks.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.29"
 name="fna.iii.29" id="fna.iii.29">29</a></sup> Here is an opinion I like to dwell upon: &ldquo;He
who will work aright must never rail, must not trouble himself
at all about what is ill done, but only to do well himself.
For the great point is, not to pull down, but to build up and
in this humanity finds pure joy.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.30"
 name="fna.iii.30" id="fna.iii.30">30</a></sup> It is well worth our
while to listen to a man so great as to be free from envy and
jealousy, but this was a lesson Carlyle could not learn from
his revered master. It is undoubtedly his broad mind in
connection with his wide knowledge which induced Sainte-Beuve
to write that Goethe is &ldquo;the greatest of modern critics
and of critics of all time.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.31"
 name="fna.iii.31" id="fna.iii.31">31</a></sup></p>

<p>All of the conversations did not run upon literature and
writers. Although Goethe never visited either Paris or
London, and resided for a good part of his life in the little
city of Weimar, he kept abreast of the world&#8217;s progress
through books, newspapers, and conversations with visiting
strangers. No statesman or man of business could have
had a wider outlook than Goethe, when on February 21,
1827, he thus spoke: &ldquo;I should wish to see England in possession
of a canal through the Isthmus of Suez&hellip;. And
it may be foreseen that the United States, with its decided
predilection to the West will, in thirty or forty years, have
occupied and peopled the large tract of land beyond the
Rocky Mountains. It may furthermore be foreseen that
along the whole coast of the Pacific Ocean where nature
has already formed the most capacious and secure harbors,
<a name="png.080" id="png.080"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>important commercial towns will gradually arise, for the
furtherance of a great intercourse between China and the
East Indies and the United States. In such a case, it would
not only be desirable, but almost necessary, that a more
rapid communication should be maintained between the
eastern and western shores of North America, both by merchant
ships and men-of-war than has hitherto been possible
with the tedious, disagreeable, and expensive voyage around
Cape Horn&hellip;. It is absolutely indispensable for the
United States to effect a passage from the Gulf of Mexico to
the Pacific Ocean, and I am certain that they will do it.
Would that I might live to see it!&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.32"
 name="fna.iii.32" id="fna.iii.32">32</a></sup></p>

<p>&ldquo;Eckermann&#8217;s book,&rdquo; wrote Sainte-Beuve, &ldquo;is the best
biography of Goethe; that of Lewes, for the facts; that of
Eckermann, for the portrait from the inside and the physiognomy.
The soul of a great man breathes in it.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.33"
 name="fna.iii.33" id="fna.iii.33">33</a></sup></p>

<p>I have had frequent occasion to speak of Sainte-Beuve
and I cannot recommend our student too strongly to read
from time to time some of his critical essays. His best work
is contained in the fifteen volumes of &ldquo;Causeries du Lundi&rdquo;
and in the thirteen volumes of &ldquo;Nouveaux Lundis&rdquo; which
were articles written for the daily newspapers, the <cite>Constitutionnel</cite>,
the <cite>Moniteur</cite>, and the <cite>Temps</cite>, when, between the
ages of forty-five and sixty-five, he was at the maturity of
his powers. Considering the very high quality of the work,
the quantity is enormous, and makes us call to mind the remark
of Goethe that &ldquo;genius and fecundity are very closely
allied.&rdquo; Excluding Goethe, we may safely, I think, call
Sainte-Beuve the greatest of modern critics, and there is
enough of resemblance between historical and literary criticism
to warrant a study by the historian of these remarkable
essays. &ldquo;The root of everything in his criticism,&rdquo; wrote
<a name="png.081" id="png.081"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Matthew Arnold, &ldquo;is his single-hearted devotion to truth.
What he called &lsquo;fictions&rsquo; in literature, in politics, in religion,
were not allowed to influence him.&rdquo; And Sainte-Beuve
himself has said, &ldquo;I am accustomed incessantly to call my
judgments in question anew and to recast my opinions the
moment I suspect them to be without validity.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.34"
 name="fna.iii.34" id="fna.iii.34">34</a></sup> The
writer who conforms to such a high standard is an excellent
guide for the historian and no one who has made a study of
these Causeries can help feeling their spirit of candor and
being inspired to the attempt to realize so high an ideal.</p>

<p>Sainte-Beuve&#8217;s essays deal almost entirely with French
literature and history, which were the subjects he knew
best. It is very desirable for us Anglo-Saxons to broaden
our minds and soften our prejudices by excursions outside
of our own literature and history, and with Goethe for our
guide in Germany, we can do no better than to accept Sainte-Beuve
for France. Brunetière wrote that the four literary
men of France in the nineteenth century who had exercised
the most profound influence were Sainte-Beuve, Balzac,
Victor Hugo, and Auguste Comte.<sup><a href="#fn.iii.35"
 name="fna.iii.35" id="fna.iii.35">35</a></sup> I have already
recommended Balzac, who portrays the life of the nineteenth
century; and Sainte-Beuve, in developing the thought of
the same period, gives us a history of French literature and
society. Moreover, his volumes are valuable to one who is
studying human character by the means of books. &ldquo;Sainte-Beuve
had,&rdquo; wrote Henry James, &ldquo;two passions which are
commonly assumed to exclude each other, the passion for
scholarship and the passion for life. He valued life and
literature equally for the light they threw on each other;
to his mind, one implied the other; he was unable to conceive
of them apart.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.36"
 name="fna.iii.36" id="fna.iii.36">36</a></sup></p>

<p>Supposing the student to have devoted five years to this
<a name="png.082" id="png.082"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>general preparation and to have arrived at the age of thirty,
which Motley, in similar advice to an aspiring historian,
fixed as the earliest age at which one should devote himself
to his special work, he is ready to choose a period and write
a history, if indeed his period has not already suggested
itself during his years of general preparation. At all events
it is doubtless that his own predilection will fix his country
and epoch and the only counsel I have to offer is to select
an interesting period. As to this, opinions will differ; but
I would say for example that the attractive parts of German
history are the Reformation, the Thirty Years&#8217; War, the
epoch of Frederick the Great, and the unification of Germany
which we have witnessed in our own day. The French
Revolution is to me the most striking period in modern
annals, whilst the history of the Directory is dull, relieved
only by the exploits of Napoleon; but when Napoleon becomes
the chief officer of state, interest revives and we
follow with unflagging attention the story of this master of
men, for which there is a superabundance of material, in
striking contrast with the little that is known about his
Titanic predecessors, Alexander and C&aelig;sar, in the accounts
of whose careers conjecture must so frequently come to the
aid of facts to construct a continuous story. The Restoration
and the reign of Louis Philippe would for me be dull
periods were they not illumined by the novels of Balzac;
but from the Revolution of 1848 to the fall of the Second
Empire and the Commune, a wonderful drama was enacted.
In our own history the Revolutionary War, the framing of
the Constitution, and Washington&#8217;s administrations seem
to me replete with interest which is somewhat lacking for
the period between Washington and the slavery conflict.
&ldquo;As to special history,&rdquo; wrote Motley to the aspiring historian,
&ldquo;I should be inclined rather to direct your attention
<a name="png.083" id="png.083"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to that of the last three and a half centuries.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.37"
 name="fna.iii.37" id="fna.iii.37">37</a></sup> Discussing
the subject before the advanced historical students of Harvard
a number of years ago, I gave an extension to Motley&#8217;s
counsel by saying that ancient history had better be left to
the Germans. I was fresh from reading Holm&#8217;s History
of Greece and was impressed with his vast learning, elaboration
of detail, and exhaustive treatment of every subject
which seemed to me to require a steady application and patience,
hardly consonant with the American character. But
within the past five years Ferrero, an Italian, has demonstrated
that others besides Germans are equal to the work
by writing an interesting history of Rome, which intelligent
men and scholars discuss in the same breath with Mommsen&#8217;s.
Courageously adopting the title &ldquo;Grandeur and
Decadence of Rome&rdquo; which suggests that of Montesquieu,
Ferrero has gleaned the well-reaped field from the appearance
of Julius C&aelig;sar to the reign of Augustus<sup><a href="#fn.iii.38"
 name="fna.iii.38" id="fna.iii.38">38</a></sup> in a manner
to attract the attention of the reading public in Italy,
France, England, and the United States. There is no reason
why an American should not have done the same. &ldquo;All
history is public property,&rdquo; wrote Motley in the letter previously
referred to. &ldquo;All history may be rewritten and it
is impossible that with exhaustive research and deep reflection
you should not be able to produce something new
and valuable on almost any subject.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.39"
 name="fna.iii.39" id="fna.iii.39">39</a></sup></p>

<p>After the student has chosen his period I have little advice
to offer him beyond what I have previously given in two
formal addresses before the American Historical Association,
but a few additional words may be useful. You will evolve
your own method by practice and by comparison with the
methods of other historians. &ldquo;Follow your own star.&rdquo;
<a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>If you feel impelled to praise or blame as do the older historians,
if it is forced upon you that your subject demands
such treatment, proceed fearlessly, so that you do nothing
for effect, so that you do not sacrifice the least particle of
truth for a telling statement. If, however, you fall naturally
into the rigorously judicial method of Gardiner you may
feel your position sure. It is well, as the scientific historians
warn you, to be suspicious of interesting things, but,
on the other hand, every interesting incident is not necessarily
untrue. If you have made a conscientious search
for historical material and use it with scrupulous honesty,
have no fear that you will transgress any reasonable canon
of historical writing.</p>

<p>An obvious question to be put to a historian is, What
plan do you follow in making notes of your reading? Langlois,
an experienced teacher and tried scholar, in his introduction
to the &ldquo;Study of History,&rdquo; condemns the natural
impulse to set them down in notebooks in the order in
which one&#8217;s authorities are studied, and says, &ldquo;Every one
admits nowadays that it is advisable to collect materials
on separate cards or slips of paper,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.40"
 name="fna.iii.40" id="fna.iii.40">40</a></sup> arranging them by a
systematic classification of subjects. This is a case in point
where writers will, I think, learn best from their own experience.
I have made my notes mainly in notebooks on
the plan which Langlois condemns, but by colored pencil-marks
of emphasis and summary, I keep before me the
prominent facts which I wish to combine; and I have
found this, on the whole, better than the card system. For
I have aimed to study my authorities in a logical succession.
First I go over the period in some general history, if one is
to be had; then I read very carefully my original authorities
in the order of their estimated importance, making
<a name="png.085" id="png.085"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>copious excerpts. Afterwards I skim my second-hand
materials. Now I maintain that it is logical and natural
to have the extracts before me in the order of my study.
When unusually careful and critical treatment has been
required, I have drawn off my memoranda from the notebooks
to cards, classifying them according to subjects.
Such a method enables me to digest thoroughly my materials,
but in the main I find that a frequent re-perusal of my
notes answers fully as well and is an economy of time.</p>

<p>Carlyle, in answer to an inquiry regarding his own procedure,
has gone to the heart of the matter. &ldquo;I go into the
business,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with all the intelligence, patience,
silence, and other gifts and virtues that I have &hellip; and
on the whole try to keep the whole matter simmering in the
<em>living</em> mind and memory rather than laid up in paper bundles
or otherwise laid up in the inert way. For this certainly
turns out to be a truth; only what you at last <em>have
living</em> in your own memory and heart is worth putting down
to be printed; this alone has much chance to get into the
living heart and memory of other men. And here indeed,
I believe, is the essence of all the rules I have ever been able
to devise for myself. I have tried various schemes of arrangement
and artificial helps to remembrance,&rdquo; but the
gist of the matter is, &ldquo;to keep the thing you are elaborating
as much as possible actually <em>in</em> your own living mind; in
order that this same mind, as much awake as possible, may
have a chance to make something of it!&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.iii.41"
 name="fna.iii.41" id="fna.iii.41">41</a></sup></p>

<p>The objection may be made to my discourse that I have
considered our student as possessing the purse of Fortunatus
and have lost sight of Herbert Spencer&#8217;s doctrine that
a very important part of education is to fit a man to acquire
the means of living. I may reply that there are a number
<a name="png.086" id="png.086"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of Harvard students who will not have to work for their
bread and whose parents would be glad to have them follow
the course that I have recommended. It is not too much
to hope, therefore, that among these there are, to use Huxley&#8217;s
words, &ldquo;glorious sports of nature&rdquo; who will not be
&ldquo;corrupted by luxury&rdquo; but will become industrious historians.
To others who are not so fortunately situated, I
cannot recommend the profession of historian as a means
of gaining a livelihood. Bancroft and Parkman, who had a
good deal of popularity, spent more money in the collection
and copying of documents than they ever received as income
from their histories. A young friend of mine, at the
outset of his career and with his living in part to be earned,
went for advice to Carl Schurz, who was very fond of him.
&ldquo;What is your aim?&rdquo; asked Mr. Schurz. &ldquo;I purpose being
a historian,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; laughed Schurz,
&ldquo;you are adopting an aristocratic profession, one which
requires a rent-roll.&rdquo; Every aspiring historian has, I suppose,
dreamed of that check of £20,000, which Macaulay
received as royalty on his history for its sale during the year
1856,<sup><a href="#fn.iii.42" name="fna.iii.42"
 id="fna.iii.42">42</a></sup> but no such dream has since been realized.</p>

<p>Teaching and writing are allied pursuits. And the teacher
helps the writer, especially in history, through the necessary
elaboration and digestion of materials. Much excellent
history is given to the world by college professors. Law
and medicine are too exacting professions with too large a
literature of their own to leave any leisure for historical
investigation. If one has the opportunity to get a good
start, or, in the talk of the day, the right sort of a &ldquo;pull,&rdquo;
I can recommend business as a means of gaining a competence
which shall enable one to devote one&#8217;s whole time
to a favorite pursuit. Grote was a banker until he reached
<a name="png.087" id="png.087"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the age of forty-nine when he retired from the banking house
and began the composition of the first volume of his history.
Henry C. Lea was in the active publishing business until he
was fifty-five, and as I have already frequently referred to
my own personal experience, I may add that I was immersed
in business between the ages of twenty-two and thirty-seven.
After three years of general and special preparation
I began my writing at forty. The business man has many
free evenings and many journeys by rail, as well as a summer
vacation, when devotion to a line of study may constitute
a valuable recreation. Much may be done in odd hours in
the way of preparation for historical work, and a business
life is an excellent school for the study of human character.</p>

<p>A paper read before the American Historical Association in Washington
on December 29, 1908; printed in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>,
May, 1909.</p>

 /></span>NEWSPAPERS AS HISTORICAL SOURCES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> impulse of an American writer in justifying the use
of newspapers as historical materials is to adopt an apologetic
tone. It is somewhat curious that such should be
the case, for newspapers satisfy so many canons of historical
evidence. They are contemporary, and, being written
without knowledge of the end, cannot bolster any cause
without making a plain showing of their intent. Their
object is the relation of daily events; and if their relation is
colored by honest or dishonest partisanship, this is easily
discernible by the critic from the internal evidence and
from an easily acquired knowledge of a few external facts.
As the journals themselves say, their aim is to print the
news; and much of the news is present politics. Moreover,
the newspaper itself, its news and editorial columns, its
advertisements, is a graphic picture of society.</p>

<p>When Aulard, in his illuminating criticism of Taine, writes
that the journals are a very important source of the history
of the French Revolution, provided they are revised and
checked by one another, the statement seems in accordance
with the canons of historical writing; and when he blames
Taine for using two journals only and neglecting ten others
which he names, the impression on the mind is the same as
if Taine were charged with the neglect of evidence of another
class. One would hardly attempt to justify Taine
by declaring that all journals are inaccurate, partisan, and
dishonest, and that the omission was a merit, not a defect.
Leaving out of account the greater size and diffuseness of
the modern journal, the dictum of Aulard would seem to
apply to any period of history.</p>

<p><a name="png.092" id="png.092"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 /></span>Why is it then that some American students fall consciously
or unconsciously into an apologetic tone when they
attempt to justify the use of newspapers as historical
sources? I suppose it is because of the attitude of cultivated
society to the newspaper of to-day. Society calls the
ordinary newspaper sensational and unreliable; and, if
neither, its accounts are so diffuse and badly proportioned
as to weary the seeker after the facts of any given transaction.
Despite the disfavor into which the American newspaper
has fallen in certain circles, I suspect that it has only
exaggerated these defects, and that the journals of different
democracies have more resemblances than diversities. The
newspaper that caters to the &ldquo;masses&rdquo; will never suit the
&ldquo;classes,&rdquo; and the necessity for a large circulation induces
it to furnish the sheet which the greatest number of readers
desire.</p>

<p>But this does not concern the historian. He does not
make his materials. He has to take them as they are. It
would undoubtedly render his task easier if all men spoke
and wrote everywhere with accuracy and sincerity; but
his work would lose much of its interest. Take the newspaper
for what it is, a hasty gatherer of facts, a hurried
commentator on the same, and it may well constitute a part
of historical evidence.</p>

<p>When, in 1887, I began the critical study of the History
of the United States from 1850 to 1860, I was struck with the
paucity of material which would serve the purpose of an
animated narrative. The main facts were to be had in the
state papers, the Statutes, the <cite>Congressional Globe</cite> and documents,
the records of national conventions and platforms,
and the tabulated results of elections. But there was much
less private correspondence than is available for the early
history of our country; and, compared with the period of
<a name="png.093" id="png.093"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the Civil War and later, a scarcity of biographies and reminiscences,
containing personal letters of high historical
value. Since I wrote my first two volumes, much new matter
concerning the decade of 1850 to 1860 has been published.
The work of the American Historical Association, and of
many historical societies, the monographs of advanced university
students, have thrown light upon this, as they
have upon other periods, with the result that future delvers
in this field can hardly be so much struck with the paucity
of material as I was twenty-one years ago.</p>

<p>Boy though I was during the decade of 1850 to 1860, I had
a vivid remembrance of the part that the newspaper played
in politics, and the thought came to me that the best way
to arrive at the spirit of the times was to steep my mind in
journalistic material; that there was the secret of living
over again that decade, as the Abolitionist, the Republican,
the Whig, and the Democrat had actually lived in it. In
the critical use of such sources, I was helped by the example
of von Holst, who employed them freely in his volumes
covering the same period, and by the counsel and collaboration
of my friend Edward G. Bourne, whose training was
in the modern school. For whatever training I had beyond
that of self came from the mastery, under the guidance of
teachers, of certain general historians belonging to an epoch
when power of expression was as much studied as the collecting
and sifting of evidence.</p>

<p>While considering my materials, I was struck with a
statement cited by Herbert Spencer as an illustration in his
&ldquo;Philosophy of Style&rdquo;: &ldquo;A modern newspaper statement,
though probably true, if quoted in a book as testimony,
would be laughed at; but the letter of a court gossip, if
written some centuries ago, is thought good historical evidence.&rdquo;
At about the same time, I noticed that Motley
<a name="png.094" id="png.094"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>used as one of his main authorities for the battle of St.
Quentin the manuscript of an anonymous writer. From
these two circumstances, it was a logical reflection that
some historians might make an exaggerated estimate of the
value of manuscript material because it reposed in dusty
archives and could be utilized only by severe labor and
long patience; and that, imbued with this idea, other historians
for other periods might neglect the newspaper because
of its ready accessibility.</p>

<p>These several considerations justified a belief, arrived at
from my preliminary survey of the field, that the use of newspapers
as sources for the decade of 1850 to 1860 was desirable.
At each step of my pretty thorough study of them, I became
more and more convinced that I was on the right track. I
found facts in them which I could have found nowhere else.
The public meeting is a great factor in the political life of
this decade, and is most fully and graphically reported in
the press. The newspaper, too, was a vehicle for personal
accounts of a quasi-confidential nature, of which I can give
a significant example. In an investigation that Edward
Bourne made for me during the summer of 1889, he came
across in the <cite>Boston Courier</cite> an inside account of the
Whig convention of 1852, showing, more conclusively than
I have seen elsewhere, the reason of the failure to unite the
conservative Whigs, who were apparently in a majority, on
Webster. From collateral evidence we were convinced
that it was written by a Massachusetts delegate; and the
<cite>Springfield Republican</cite>, which copied the account, furnished
a confirmation of it. It was an interesting story, and I
incorporated it in my narrative.</p>

<p>I am well aware that Dr. Dryasdust may ask, What of it?
The report of the convention shows that Webster received
a very small vote and that Scott was nominated. Why
<a name="png.095" id="png.095"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>waste time and words over the &ldquo;might have been&rdquo;? I can
plead only the human interest in the great Daniel Webster
ardently desiring that nomination, Rufus Choate advocating
it in sublime oratory, the two antislavery delegates
from Massachusetts refusing their votes for Webster, thus
preventing a unanimous Massachusetts, and the delegates
from Maine, among whom was Webster&#8217;s godson William P.
Fessenden, coldly refusing their much-needed aid.</p>

<p>General Scott, having received the nomination, made a
stumping tour in the autumn through some of the Western
States. No accurate account of it is possible without the
newspapers, yet it was esteemed a factor in his overwhelming
defeat, and the story of it is well worth preserving as data
for a discussion of the question, Is it wise for a presidential
candidate to make a stumping tour during his electoral
campaign?</p>

<p>The story of the formation of the Republican party, and
the rise of the Know-nothings, may possibly be written
without recourse to the newspapers, but thorough steeping
in such material cannot fail to add to the animation and accuracy
of the story. In detailed history and biographical
books, dates, through mistakes of the writer or printer,
are frequently wrong; and when the date was an affair of
supreme importance, I have sometimes found a doubt resolved
by a reference to the newspaper, which, from its
strictly contemporary character, cannot in such a matter
lead one astray.</p>

<p>I found the newspapers of value in the correction of logical
assumptions, which frequently appear in American historical
and biographical books, especially in those written by men
who bore a part in public affairs. By a logical assumption,
I mean the statement of a seemingly necessary consequence
which apparently ought to follow some well-attested fact or
<a name="png.096" id="png.096"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>condition. A striking instance of this occurred during the
political campaign of 1856, when &ldquo;bleeding Kansas&rdquo; was a
thrilling catchword used by the Republicans, whose candidate
for president was Frémont. In a year and a half seven
free-state men had been killed in Kansas by the border
ruffians, and these outrages, thoroughly ventilated, made
excellent campaign ammunition. But the Democrats had
a <em>tu quoque</em> argument which ought to have done much towards
eliminating this question from the canvass.</p>

<p>On the night of May 24, 1856, five pro-slavery men, living
on the Pottawatomie Creek, were deliberately and foully
murdered by John Brown and seven of his disciples; and,
while this massacre caused profound excitement in Kansas
and Missouri, it seems to have had no influence east of the
Mississippi River, although the fact was well attested. A
Kansas journalist of 1856, writing in 1879, made this logical
assumption: &ldquo;The opposition press both North and South
took up the damning tale &hellip; of that midnight butchery
on the Pottawatomie&hellip;. Whole columns of leaders
from week to week, with startling headlines, liberally distributed
capitals, and frightful exclamation points, filled
all the newspapers.&rdquo; And it was his opinion that, had it
not been for this massacre, Frémont would have been elected.</p>

<p>But I could not discover that the massacre had any influence
on the voters in the pivotal states. I examined,
or had examined, the files of the <cite>New York Journal of
Commerce</cite>, <cite>New York Herald</cite>, <cite>Philadelphia Pennsylvanian</cite>,
<cite>Washington Union</cite>, and <cite>Cleveland Plain Dealer</cite>, all Democratic
papers except the <cite>New York Herald</cite>, and I was struck
with the fact that substantially no use was made of the massacre
as a campaign argument. Yet could anything have
been more logical than the assumption that the Democrats
would have been equal to their opportunity and spread far
<a name="png.097" id="png.097"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and wide such a story? The facts in the case show therefore
that cause and effect in actual American history are
not always the same as the statesman may conceive them
in his cabinet or the historian in his study.</p>

<p>In the newspapers of 1850 to 1860 many speeches, and
many public, and some private, letters of conspicuous public
men are printed; these are valuable material for the history
of the decade, and their use is in entire accordance with
modern historical canons.</p>

<p>I have so far considered the press in its character of a
register of facts; but it has a further use for historical purposes,
since it is both a representative and guide of public
sentiment. Kinglake shows that the <cite>Times</cite> was the potent
influence which induced England to invade the Crimea;
Bismarck said in 1877 that the press &ldquo;was the cause of the
last three wars&rdquo;; Lord Cromer writes, &ldquo;The people of England
as represented by the press insisted on sending General
Gordon to the Soudan, and accordingly to the Soudan he
was sent;&rdquo; and it is current talk that the yellow journals
brought on the Spanish-American War. Giving these statements
due weight, can a historian be justified in neglecting
the important influence of the press on public opinion?</p>

<p>As reflecting and leading popular sentiment during the
decade of 1850 to 1860, the newspapers of the Northern
States were potent. I own that many times one needs no
further index to public sentiment than our frequent elections,
but in 1854 conditions were peculiar. The repeal of
the Missouri Compromise had outraged the North and indicated
that a new party must be formed to resist the extension
of slavery. In the disorganization of the Democratic
party, and the effacement of the Whig, nowhere may
the new movement so well be traced as in the news and
editorial columns of the newspapers, and in the speeches of
<a name="png.098" id="png.098"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the Northern leaders, many of these indeed being printed
nowhere else than in the press. What journals and what
journalists there were in those days! Greeley and Dana
of the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>; Bryant and Bigelow of the
<cite>Evening Post</cite>; Raymond of the <cite>Times</cite>; Webb of the <cite>Courier</cite>
and <cite>Enquirer</cite>; Bowles of the <cite>Springfield Republican</cite>; Thurlow
Weed of the <cite>Albany Journal</cite>; Schouler of the <cite>Cincinnati
Gazette</cite>,&mdash;all inspired by their opposition to the spread of
slavery, wrote with vigor and enthusiasm, representing the
ideas of men who had burning thoughts without power of
expression, and guiding others who needed the constant
iteration of positive opinions to determine their political
action.</p>

<p>The main and cross currents which resulted in the formation
of the compact Republican party of 1856 have their
principal record in the press, and from it, directly or indirectly,
must the story be told. Unquestionably the newspapers
had greater influence than in an ordinary time,
because the question was a moral one and could be concretely
put. Was slavery right or wrong? If wrong, should not
its extension be stopped? That was the issue, and all the
arguments, constitutional and social, turned on that point.</p>

<p>The greatest single journalistic influence was the <cite>New
York Weekly Tribune</cite> which had in 1854 a circulation of
112,000, and many times that number of readers. These
readers were of the thorough kind, reading all the news, all
the printed speeches and addresses, and all the editorials,
and pondering as they read. The questions were discussed
in their family circles and with their neighbors, and, as
differences arose, the <cite>Tribune</cite>, always at hand, was consulted
and re-read. There being few popular magazines during
this decade, the weekly newspaper, in some degree, took
their place; and, through this medium, Greeley and his
<a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>able coadjutors spoke to the people of New York and of
the West, where New England ideas predominated, with a
power never before or since known in this country. When
Motley was studying the old letters and documents of the
sixteenth century in the archives of Brussels, he wrote:
&ldquo;It is something to read the real <em>bona fide</em> signs manual of
such fellows as William of Orange, Count Egmont, Alexander
Farnese, Philip the Second, Cardinal Granville and
the rest of them. It gives a &lsquo;realizing sense,&rsquo; as the Americans
have it.&rdquo; I had somewhat of the same feeling as I
turned over the pages of the bound volumes of the <cite>Weekly
Tribune</cite>, reading the editorials and letters of Greeley, the
articles of Dana and Hildreth. I could recall enough of
the time to feel the influence of this political bible, as it was
termed, and I can emphatically say that if you want to penetrate
into the thoughts, feelings, and ground of decision
of the 1,866,000 men who voted for Lincoln in 1860, you
should study with care the <cite>New York Weekly Tribune</cite>.</p>

<p>One reason why the press was a better representative of
opinion during the years from 1854 to 1860 than now is
that there were few, if any, independent journals. The
party man read his own newspaper and no other; in that,
he found an expression of his own views. And the party
newspaper in the main printed only the speeches and arguments
of its own side. Greeley on one occasion was asked
by John Russell Young, an associate, for permission to reprint
a speech of Horatio Seymour in full as a matter of
news. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Greeley said, &ldquo;I will print Seymour&#8217;s speech
when the <cite>World</cite> will print those of our side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the war, Charleston was one of the most interesting
cities of the country. It was a small aristocratic community,
with an air of refinement and distinction. The story of
Athens proclaims that a large population is not necessary
<a name="png.100" id="png.100"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to exercise a powerful influence on the world; and, after
the election of Lincoln in 1860, the 40,000 people of Charleston,
or rather the few patricians who controlled its fate and
that of South Carolina, attracted the attention of the whole
country. The story of the secession movement of November
and December, 1860, cannot be told with correctness
and life without frequent references to the <cite>Charleston Mercury</cite>
and the <cite>Charleston Courier</cite>. The <cite>Mercury</cite> especially
was an index of opinion, and so vivid is its daily chronicle
of events that the historian is able to put himself in the
place of those ardent South Carolinians and understand
their point of view.</p>

<p>For the history of the Civil War, newspapers are not so
important. The other material is superabundant, and in
choosing from the mass of it, the newspapers, so-far as affairs
at the North are concerned, need only be used in special
cases, and rarely for matters of fact. The accounts of campaigns
and battles, which filled so much of their space, may
be ignored, as the best possible authorities for these are the
one hundred and twenty-eight volumes of the United States
government publication, the &ldquo;Official Records of the Union
and Confederate armies.&rdquo; The faithful study of the correspondence
and the reports in these unique volumes is
absolutely essential to a comprehension of the war; and it
is a labor of love. When one thinks of the mass of manuscripts
students of certain periods of European history have
been obliged to read, the American historian is profoundly
grateful to his government, that at a cost to itself of nearly
three million dollars,<sup><a href="#fn.iv.1" name="fna.iv.1" id="fna.iv.1">1</a></sup>
 it has furnished him this priceless
material in neatly printed volumes with excellent indexes.
The serious student can generally procure these volumes
<a name="png.101" id="png.101"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>gratis through the favor of his congressman; or, failing in
this, may purchase the set at a moderate price, so that he is
not obliged to go to a public library to consult them.</p>

<p>Next to manuscript material, the physical and mental
labor of turning over and reading bound volumes of newspapers
is the most severe, and I remember my feeling of relief
at being able to divert my attention from what Edward L.
Pierce called this back-breaking and eye-destroying labor,
much of it in public libraries, to these convenient books in
my own private library. A mass of other materials, notably
Nicolay and Hay&#8217;s contributions, military narratives,
biographies, private correspondence, to say nothing of the
Congressional publications, render the student fairly independent
of the newspapers. But I did myself make, for
certain periods, special researches among them to ascertain
their influence on public sentiment; and I also found them
very useful in my account of the New York draft riots of
1863. It is true the press did not accurately reflect the
gloom and sickness of heart at the North after the battle
of Chancellorsville, for the reason that many editors wrote
for the purpose of keeping up the hopes of their readers. In
sum, the student may congratulate himself that a continuous
study of the Northern newspapers for the period of the
Civil War is unnecessary, for their size and diffuseness are
appalling.</p>

<p>But what I have said about the press of the North will
not apply to that of the South. Though strenuous efforts
have been made, with the diligent coöperation of Southern
men, to secure the utmost possible amount of Confederate material
for the &ldquo;Official Records,&rdquo; it actually forms only about
twenty-nine per cent of the whole matter. Other historical
material is also less copious. For example, there is no record
of the proceedings of the Confederate Congress, like the
<a name="png.102" id="png.102"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]
 </span><cite>Globe</cite>; there are no reports of committees, like that of the
Committee on the Conduct of the War; and even the journal
of the Congress was kept on loose memoranda, and not
written up until after the close of the war. With the exception
of this journal, which has been printed by our government,
and the &ldquo;Statutes at Large,&rdquo; our information of
the work of the Confederate Congress comes from the newspapers
and some books of biography and recollections.
The case of the Southern States was peculiar, because they
were so long cut off from intercourse with the outer world,
owing to the efficient Federal blockade; and the newspaper
in its local news, editorials, and advertisements, is important
material for portraying life in the Confederacy during the
Civil War. Fortunately for the student, the Southern
newspaper was not the same voluminous issue as the Northern,
and, if it had not been badly printed, its use would
be attended with little difficulty. Owing to the scarcity of
paper, many of the newspapers were gradually reduced in
size, and in the end were printed on half-sheets, occasionally
one on brown paper, and another on wall paper; even the
white paper was frequently coarse, and this, with poor type,
made the news-sheet itself a daily record of the waning
fortunes of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>In the history of Reconstruction the historian may be to
a large extent independent of the daily newspaper. For
the work of reconstruction was done by Congress, and
Congress had the full support of the Northern people, as was
shown by the continuous large Republican majority which
was maintained. The debates, the reports, and the acts of
Congress are essential, and little else is required except whatever
private correspondence may be accessible. Congress
represented public sentiment of the North, and if one desires
newspaper opinion, one may find it in many pithy
<a name="png.103" id="png.103"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>expressions on the floor of the House or the Senate. For the
congressman and the senator are industrious newspaper
readers. They are apt to read some able New York journal
which speaks for their party, and the congressman will
read the daily and weekly newspapers of his district, and
the senator the prominent ones of his state which belong
to his party.</p>

<p>For the period which covered Reconstruction, from 1865
to 1877, I used the <cite>Nation</cite> to a large extent. Its bound
volumes are convenient to handle in one&#8217;s own library, and
its summary of events is useful in itself, and as giving leads
to the investigation of other material. Frequently its
editorials have spoken for the sober sense of the people with
amazing success. As a constant reader of the <cite>Nation</cite> since
1866, I have felt the fascination of Godkin, and have been
consciously on guard against it. I tried not to be led away
by his incisive statements and sometimes uncharitable
judgments. But whatever may be thought of his bias, he
had an honest mind, and was incapable of knowingly making
a false statement; and this, with his other qualities, makes
his journal excellent historical material. After considering
with great care some friendly criticism, I can truly say that
I have no apology to make for the extent to which I used
the <cite>Nation</cite>.</p>

<p>Recurring now to the point with which I began this discussion,&mdash;that
learned prejudice against employing newspapers
as historical material,&mdash;I wish to add that, like all
other evidence, they must be used with care and skepticism,
as one good authority is undoubtedly better than a dozen
poor ones. An anecdote I heard years ago has been useful
to me in weighing different historical evidence. A Pennsylvania-Dutch
justice of the peace in one of the interior
townships of Ohio had a man arraigned before him for
<a name="png.104" id="png.104"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">96</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>stealing a pig. One witness swore that he distinctly saw the
theft committed; eight swore that they never saw the accused
steal a pig, and the verdict was worthy of Dogberry.
&ldquo;I discharge the accused,&rdquo; said the justice. &ldquo;The testimony
of eight men is certainly worth more than the testimony
of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Private and confidential correspondence is highly valuable
historical material, for such utterances are less constrained
and more sincere than public declarations; but all men cannot
be rated alike. Some men have lied as freely in private letters
as in public speeches; therefore the historian must get at
the character of the man who has written the letter and the
influences surrounding him; these factors must count in any
satisfactory estimate of his accuracy and truth. The newspaper
must be subjected to similar tests. For example, to
test an article or public letter written by Greeley or Godkin,
the general situation, the surrounding influences, and the
individual bias must be taken into account, and, when allowance
is made for these circumstances, as well as for the
public character of the utterance, it may be used for historical
evidence. For the history of the last half of the nineteenth
century just such material&mdash;the material of the
fourth estate&mdash;must be used. Neglect of it would be like
neglect of the third estate in the history of France for the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In the United States we have not, politically speaking,
either the first or second estates, but we have the third and
fourth estates with an intimate connection between the two.
Lord Cromer said, when writing of the sending of Gordon
to the Soudan, &ldquo;Newspaper government has certain disadvantages;&rdquo;
and this he emphasized by quoting a wise
remark of Sir George Cornewall Lewis, &ldquo;Anonymous authorship
places the public under the direction of guides who
<a name="png.105" id="png.105"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">97</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have no sense of personal responsibility.&rdquo; Nevertheless
this newspaper government must be reckoned with. The
duty of the historian is, not to decide if the newspapers are
as good as they ought to be, but to measure their influence
on the present, and to recognize their importance as an
ample and contemporary record of the past.</p>

DINNER AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Thanking</span> heartily the governing boards of Harvard
College for the honor conferred upon me, I shall say, on
this my first admission to the circle of the Harvard alumni,
a word on the University as it appears to one whose work
has lain outside of it. The spirit of the academy in general
and especially of this University impels men to get to the
bottom of things, to strive after exact knowledge; and this
spirit permeates my own study of history in a remarkable
degree. &ldquo;The first of all Gospels is this,&rdquo; said Carlyle,
&ldquo;that a lie cannot endure forever.&rdquo; This is the gospel of
historical students. A part of their work has been to expose
popular fallacies, and to show up errors which have
been made through partiality and misguided patriotism or
because of incomplete investigation. Men of my age are
obliged to unlearn much. The youthful student of history
has a distinct advantage over us in that he begins with a
correct knowledge of the main historical facts. He does
not for example learn what we all used to learn&mdash;that in
the year 1000 the appearance of a fiery comet caused a panic
of terror to fall upon Christendom and gave rise to the belief
that the end of the world was at hand. Nor is he taught
that the followers of Peter the Hermit in the first crusade
were a number of spiritually minded men and women of
austere morality. It is to the University that we owe it that
we are seeing things as they are in history, that the fables,
the fallacies, and the exaggerations are disappearing from
the books.</p>

 /></span>To regard the past with accuracy and truth is a preparation
for envisaging the present in the same way. For this
attitude towards the past and the present gained by college
students of history, and for other reasons which it is not
necessary here to detail, the man of University training has,
other things being equal, this advantage over him who lacks
it, that in life in the world he will get at things more certainly
and state them more accurately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A university,&rdquo; said Lowell, &ldquo;is a place where nothing
useful is taught.&rdquo; By utility Lowell undoubtedly meant,
to use the definition which Huxley puts into the average
Englishman&#8217;s mouth, &ldquo;that by which we get pudding or
praise or both.&rdquo; A natural reply to the statement of Lowell
is that great numbers of fathers every year, at a pecuniary
sacrifice, send their sons to college with the idea of fitting
them better to earn their living, in obedience to the general
sentiment of men of this country that there is a money
value to college training. But the remark of Lowell suggests
another object of the University which, to use the words
of Huxley again, is &ldquo;to catch the exceptional people, the glorious
sports of nature, and turn them to account for the
good of society.&rdquo; This appeals to those imbued with the
spirit of the academy who frankly acknowledge, in the main,
our inferiority in the scholarship, which produces great
works of literature and science, to England, Germany, and
France, and who with patriotic eagerness wish that we may
reach the height attained in the older countries. To recur
to my own study again, should we produce a historian or
historical writer the equal of Gibbon, Mommsen, Carlyle,
or Macaulay there would be a feeling of pride in our historical
genius which would make itself felt at every academical
and historical gathering. We have something of that sentiment
in regard to Francis Parkman, our most original
<a name="png.111" id="png.111"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">103</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>historian. But it may be that the historical field of Parkman
is too narrow to awaken a world-wide interest and I
suspect that the American who will be recognized as the
equal of Gibbon, Mommsen, Carlyle, or Macaulay must secure
that recognition by writing of some period of European
history better than the Englishman, German, or Frenchman
has written of it. He must do it not only in the way of
scientific history, in which in his field Henry Charles Lea has
won so much honor for himself and his country, but he
must bring to bear on his history that quality which
has made the historical writings of Gibbon, Carlyle, and
Macaulay literature.</p>

EDWARD GIBBON</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> English or American lover of history visits Rome
without bending reverent footsteps to the Church of Santa
Maria in Ara C&oelig;li. Two visits are necessary, as on the first
you are at once seized by the sacristan, who can conceive
of no other motive for entering this church on the Capitol
Hill than to see the miraculous Bambino&mdash;the painted
doll swaddled in gold and silver tissue and &ldquo;crusted over
with magnificent diamonds, emeralds, and rubies.&rdquo; When
you have heard the tale of what has been called &ldquo;the oldest
medical practitioner in Rome,&rdquo; of his miraculous cures, of
these votive offerings, the imaginary picture you had conjured
up is effaced; and it is better to go away and come
a second time when the sacristan will recognize you and
leave you to yourself. Then you may open your Gibbon&#8217;s
Autobiography and read that it was the subtle influence
of Italy and Rome that determined the choice, from amongst
many contemplated subjects of historical writing, of &ldquo;The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&rdquo; &ldquo;In my Journal,&rdquo;
wrote Gibbon, &ldquo;the place and moment of conception are
recorded; the 15th of October, 1764, in the close of the
evening, as I sat musing in the Church of the Franciscan
friars while they were singing vespers in the Temple of
Jupiter on the ruins of the Capitol.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.1"
 name="fna.vi.1" id="fna.vi.1">1</a></sup> Gibbon was twenty-seven
when he made this fruitful visit of eighteen weeks to
Rome, and his first impression, though often quoted, never
loses interest, showing, as it does, the enthusiasm of an unemotional
man. &ldquo;At the distance of twenty-five years,&rdquo;
<a name="png.116" id="png.116"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">108</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>he wrote, &ldquo;I can neither forget nor express the strong emotions
which agitated my mind as I first approached and
entered the <cite>Eternal City</cite>. After a sleepless night, I trod
with a lofty step the ruins of the Forum; each memorable
spot where Romulus <cite>stood</cite> or Cicero spoke or C&aelig;sar fell was
at once present to my eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The admirer of Gibbon as he travels northward will stop
at Lausanne and visit the hotel which bears the historian&#8217;s
name. Twice have I taken luncheon in the garden where
he wrote the last words of his history; and on a third visit,
after lunching at another inn, I could not fail to admire the
penetration of the Swiss concierge. As I alighted, he seemed
to divine at once the object of my visit, and before I had
half the words of explanation out of my mouth, he said,
&ldquo;Oh, yes. It is this way. But I cannot show you anything
but a spot.&rdquo; I have quoted from Gibbon&#8217;s Autobiography
the expression of his inspiration of twenty-seven; a fitting
companion-piece is the reflection of the man of fifty. &ldquo;I
have presumed to mark the moment of conception,&rdquo; he
wrote; &ldquo;I shall now commemorate the hour of my final
deliverance. It was on the day, or rather the night, of the
27th of June, 1787, between the hours of eleven and twelve,
that I wrote the last lines of the last page in a summer-house
in my garden&hellip;. I will not dissemble the first emotions
of joy on the recovery of my freedom and perhaps the establishment
of my fame. But my pride was soon humbled,
and a sober melancholy was spread over my mind by the
idea that I had taken my everlasting leave of an old and
agreeable companion.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.2"
 name="fna.vi.2" id="fna.vi.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the idea was conceived when Gibbon was twenty-seven,
he was thirty-one before he set himself seriously at
work to study his material. At thirty-six he began the
<a name="png.117" id="png.117"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">109</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>composition, and he was thirty-nine, when, in February, 1776,
the first quarto volume was published. The history had an
immediate success. &ldquo;My book,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;was on every
table and almost on every toilette; the historian was
crowned by the taste or fashion of the day.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.3"
 name="fna.vi.3" id="fna.vi.3">3</a></sup> The first
edition was exhausted in a few days, a second was printed
in 1776, and next year a third. The second and third volumes,
which ended the history of the Western empire,
were published in 1781, and seven years later the three volumes
devoted to the Eastern empire saw the light. The
last sentence of the work, written in the summer-house at
Lausanne, is, &ldquo;It was among the ruins of the Capitol that
I first conceived the idea of a work which has amused and
exercised near twenty years of my life, and which, however
inadequate to my own wishes, I finally deliver to the curiosity
and candor of the public.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a brief account of one of the greatest historical
works, if indeed it is not the greatest, ever written. Let us
imagine an assemblage of English, German, and American
historical scholars called upon to answer the question,
Who is the greatest modern historian? No doubt can exist
that Gibbon would have a large majority of the voices; and
I think a like meeting of French and Italian scholars would
indorse the verdict. &ldquo;Gibbon&#8217;s work will never be excelled,&rdquo;
declared Niebuhr.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.4"
 name="fna.vi.4" id="fna.vi.4">4</a></sup> &ldquo;That great master of us all,&rdquo;
said Freeman, &ldquo;whose immortal tale none of us can hope to
displace.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.5"
 name="fna.vi.5" id="fna.vi.5">5</a></sup> Bury, the latest editor of Gibbon, who has
acutely criticised and carefully weighed &ldquo;The Decline and
Fall,&rdquo; concludes &ldquo;that Gibbon is behind date in many details.
But in the main things he is still our master, above
and beyond date.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.6"
 name="fna.vi.6" id="fna.vi.6">6</a></sup> His work wins plaudits from those
<a name="png.118" id="png.118"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">110</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>who believe that history in its highest form should be literature
and from those who hold that it should be nothing
more than a scientific narrative. The disciples of Macaulay
and Carlyle, of Stubbs and Gardiner, would be found voting
in unison in my imaginary Congress. Gibbon, writes Bury,
is &ldquo;the historian and the man of letters,&rdquo; thus ranking with
Thucydides and Tacitus. These three are put in the highest
class, exemplifying that &ldquo;brilliance of style and accuracy
of statement are perfectly compatible in an historian.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.7"
 name="fna.vi.7" id="fna.vi.7">7</a></sup>
Accepting this authoritative classification it is well worth
while to point out the salient differences between the ancient
historians and the modern. From Thucydides we have
twenty-four years of contemporary history of his own country.
If the whole of the Annals and History of Tacitus
had come down to us, we should have had eighty-three
years; as it is, we actually have forty-one of nearly contemporary
history of the Roman Empire. Gibbon&#8217;s tale covers
1240 years. He went far beyond his own country for his
subject, and the date of his termination is three centuries
before he was born. Milman spoke of &ldquo;the amplitude, the
magnificence, and the harmony of Gibbon&#8217;s design,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.8"
 name="fna.vi.8" id="fna.vi.8">8</a></sup> and
Bury writes, &ldquo;If we take into account the vast range of his
work, his accuracy is amazing.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.9"
 name="fna.vi.9" id="fna.vi.9">9</a></sup> Men have wondered and
will long wonder at the brain with such a grasp and with
the power to execute skillfully so mighty a conception. &ldquo;The
public is seldom wrong&rdquo; in their judgment of a book, wrote
Gibbon in his Autobiography,<sup><a href="#fn.vi.10"
 name="fna.vi.10" id="fna.vi.10">10</a></sup> and, if that be true at the
time of actual publication to which Gibbon intended to
apply the remark, how much truer it is in the long run of
years. &ldquo;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&rdquo; has
had a life of over one hundred and thirty years, and there is
no indication that it will not endure as long as any interest
<a name="png.119" id="png.119"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">111</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>is taken in the study of history. &ldquo;I have never presumed
to accept a place in the triumvirate of British historians,&rdquo;
said Gibbon, referring to Hume and Robertson. But in our
day Hume and Robertson gather dust on the shelf, while
Gibbon is continually studied by students and read by serious
men.</p>

<p>A work covering Gibbon&#8217;s vast range of time would have
been impossible for Thucydides or Tacitus. Historical skepticism
had not been fully enough developed. There had
not been a sufficient sifting and criticism of historical materials
for a master&#8217;s work of synthesis. And it is probable
that Thucydides lacked a model. Tacitus could indeed have
drawn inspiration from the Greek, while Gibbon had lessons
from both, showing a profound study of Tacitus and a
thorough acquaintance with Thucydides.</p>

<p>If circumstances then made it impossible for the Greek
or the Roman to attempt history on the grand scale of Gibbon,
could Gibbon have written contemporary history with
accuracy and impartiality equal to his great predecessors?
This is one of those delightful questions that may be ever
discussed and never resolved. When twenty-three years
old, arguing against the desire of his father that he should
go into Parliament, Gibbon assigned, as one of the reasons,
that he lacked &ldquo;necessary prejudices of party and of nation&rdquo;;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.11"
 name="fna.vi.11" id="fna.vi.11">11</a></sup>
and when in middle life he embraced the fortunate
opportunity of becoming a member of the House of Commons,
he thus summed up his experience, &ldquo;The eight sessions
that I sat in Parliament were a school of civil prudence, the
first and most essential virtue of an historian.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.12"
 name="fna.vi.12" id="fna.vi.12">12</a></sup> At the
end of this political career, Gibbon, in a private letter to
an intimate Swiss friend, gave the reason why he had embraced
it. &ldquo;I entered Parliament,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without
<a name="png.120" id="png.120"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">112</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>patriotism, and without ambition, and I had no other aim
than to secure the comfortable and honest place of a <em>Lord of
Trade</em>. I obtained this place at last. I held it for three
years, from 1779 to 1782, and the net annual product of it,
being £750 sterling, increased my revenue to the level of
my wants and desires.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.13"
 name="fna.vi.13" id="fna.vi.13">13</a></sup> His retirement from Parliament
was followed by ten years&#8217; residence at Lausanne, in the first
four of which he completed his history. A year and a half
after his removal to Lausanne, he referred, in a letter to his
closest friend, Lord Sheffield, to the &ldquo;abyss of your cursed
politics,&rdquo; and added: &ldquo;I never was a very warm patriot
and I grow every day a citizen of the world. The scramble
for power and profit at Westminster or St. James&#8217;s, and the
names of Pitt and Fox become less interesting to me than
those of C&aelig;sar and Pompey.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.14"
 name="fna.vi.14" id="fna.vi.14">14</a></sup></p>

<p>These expressions would seem to indicate that Gibbon
might have written contemporary history well and that the
candor displayed in &ldquo;The Decline and Fall&rdquo; might not have
been lacking had he written of England in his own time.
But that subject he never contemplated. When twenty-four
years old he had however considered a number of English
periods and finally fixed upon Sir Walter Raleigh for
his hero; but a year later, he wrote in his journal: &ldquo;I
shrink with terror from the modern history of England,
where every character is a problem, and every reader a
friend or an enemy; where a writer is supposed to hoist a
flag of party and is devoted to damnation by the adverse
faction&hellip;. I must embrace a safer and more extensive
theme.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.15"
 name="fna.vi.15" id="fna.vi.15">15</a></sup></p>

<p>How well Gibbon knew himself! Despite his coolness
and candor, war and revolution revealed his strong Tory
prejudices, which he undoubtedly feared might color any
<a name="png.121" id="png.121"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>history of England that he might undertake. &ldquo;I took my
seat,&rdquo; in the House of Commons, he wrote, &ldquo;at the beginning
of the memorable contest between Great Britain and America;
and supported with many a sincere and <em>silent</em> vote
the rights though perhaps not the interests of the mother
country.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.16"
 name="fna.vi.16" id="fna.vi.16">16</a></sup> In 1782 he recorded the conclusion: &ldquo;The
American war had once been the favorite of the country,
the pride of England was irritated by the resistance of her
colonies, and the executive power was driven by national
clamor into the most vigorous and coercive measures.&rdquo;
But it was a fruitless contest. Armies were lost; the debt
and taxes were increased; the hostile confederacy of France,
Spain and Holland was disquieting. As a result the war
became unpopular and Lord North&#8217;s ministry fell. Dr.
Johnson thought that no nation not absolutely conquered
had declined so much in so short a time. &ldquo;We seem to be
sinking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am afraid of a civil war.&rdquo; Dr. Franklin,
according to Horace Walpole, said &ldquo;he would furnish
Mr. Gibbon with materials for writing the History of the
Decline of the British Empire.&rdquo; With his country tottering,
the self-centered but truthful Gibbon could not avoid mention
of his personal loss, due to the fall of his patron, Lord
North. &ldquo;I was stripped of a convenient salary,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;after having enjoyed it about three years.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.17"
 name="fna.vi.17" id="fna.vi.17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>The outbreak of the French Revolution intensified his
conservatism. He was then at Lausanne, the tranquillity
of which was broken up by the dissolution of the neighboring
kingdom. Many Lausanne families were terrified by the
menace of bankruptcy. &ldquo;This town and country,&rdquo; Gibbon
wrote, &ldquo;are crowded with noble exiles, and we sometimes
<a name="png.122" id="png.122"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">114</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>count in an assembly a dozen princesses and duchesses.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.18"
 name="fna.vi.18" id="fna.vi.18">18</a></sup>
Bitter disputes between them and the triumphant Democrats
disturbed the harmony of social circles. Gibbon
espoused the cause of the royalists. &ldquo;I beg leave to subscribe
my assent to Mr. Burke&#8217;s creed on the Revolution of
France,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;I admire his eloquence, I approve
his politics, I adore his chivalry, and I can almost excuse his
reverence for Church establishments.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.19"
 name="fna.vi.19" id="fna.vi.19">19</a></sup> Thirteen days
after the massacre of the Swiss guard in the attack on the
Tuileries in August, 1792, Gibbon wrote to Lord Sheffield,
&ldquo;The last revolution of Paris appears to have convinced
almost everybody of the fatal consequences of Democratical
principles which lead by a path of flowers into the abyss of
hell.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.20"
 name="fna.vi.20" id="fna.vi.20">20</a></sup> Gibbon, who was astonished by so few things in
history, wrote Sainte-Beuve, was amazed by the French
Revolution.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.21"
 name="fna.vi.21" id="fna.vi.21">21</a></sup> Nothing could be more natural. The historian
in his study may consider the fall of dynasties, social
upheavals, violent revolutions, and the destruction of order
without a tremor. The things have passed away. The
events furnish food for his reflections and subjects for his
pen, while sanguine uprisings at home or in a neighboring
country in his own time inspire him with terror lest the oft-prophesied
dissolution of society is at hand. It is the difference
between the earthquake in your own city and the
one 3000 miles away. As Gibbon&#8217;s pocket-nerve was
sensitive, it may be he was also thinking of the £1300 he
had invested in 1784 in the new loan of the King of France,
deeming the French funds as solid as the English.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.22"
 name="fna.vi.22" id="fna.vi.22">22</a></sup></p>

<p>It is well now to repeat our dictum that Gibbon is the
greatest modern historian, but, in reasserting this, it is no
more than fair to cite the opinions of two dissentients&mdash;the
<a name="png.123" id="png.123"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">115</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>great literary historians of the nineteenth century,
Macaulay and Carlyle. &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; wrote Macaulay
in his diary, &ldquo;that I admire no historians much except Herodotus,
Thucydides, and Tacitus&hellip;. There is merit no
doubt in Hume, Robertson, Voltaire, and Gibbon. Yet it
is not the thing. I have a conception of history more just,
I am confident, than theirs.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.23"
 name="fna.vi.23" id="fna.vi.23">23</a></sup> &ldquo;Gibbon,&rdquo; said Carlyle in
a public lecture, is &ldquo;a greater historian than Robertson
but not so great as Hume. With all his swagger and bombast,
no man ever gave a more futile account of human
things than he has done of the decline and fall of the Roman
Empire; assigning no profound cause for these phenomena,
nothing but diseased nerves, and all sorts of miserable motives,
to the actors in them.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.24"
 name="fna.vi.24" id="fna.vi.24">24</a></sup> Carlyle&#8217;s statement shows
envious criticism as well as a prejudice in favor of his brother
Scotchman. It was made in 1838, since when opinion has
raised Gibbon to the top, for he actually lives while Hume
is read perfunctorily, if at all. Moreover among the three&mdash;Gibbon,
Macaulay, and Carlyle&mdash;whose works are literature
as well as history, modern criticism has no hesitation in
awarding the palm to Gibbon.</p>

<p>Before finally deciding upon his subject Gibbon thought
of &ldquo;The History of the Liberty of the Swiss&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
History of the Republic of Florence under the House of
Medicis,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.25"
 name="fna.vi.25" id="fna.vi.25">25</a></sup> but in the end, as we have seen, he settled on the
later history of the Roman Empire, showing, as Lowell
said of Parkman, his genius in the choice of his subject. His
history really begins with the death of Marcus Aurelius,
180&nbsp;<span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span>, but the main narrative is preceded by three excellent
introductory chapters, covering in Bury&#8217;s edition eighty-two
pages. After the completion of his work, he regretted
<a name="png.124" id="png.124"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">116</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that he had not begun it at an earlier period. On the first
page of his own printed copy of his book where he announces
his design, he has entered this marginal note: &ldquo;Should I not
have given the <em>history</em> of that fortunate period which was interposed
between two iron ages? Should I not have deduced
the decline of the Empire from the Civil Wars that ensued
after the Fall of Nero or even from the tyranny which succeeded
the reign of Augustus? Alas! I should; but of
what avail is this tardy knowledge?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.26"
 name="fna.vi.26" id="fna.vi.26">26</a></sup> We may echo
Gibbon&#8217;s regret that he had not commenced his history
with the reign of Tiberius, as, in his necessary use of Tacitus,
we should have had the running comment of one great historian
on another, of which we have a significant example
in Gibbon&#8217;s famous sixteenth chapter wherein he discusses
Tacitus&#8217;s account of the persecution of the Christians by
Nero. With his power of historic divination, he would have
so absorbed Tacitus and his time that the history would
almost have seemed a collaboration between two great and
sympathetic minds. &ldquo;Tacitus,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;very frequently
trusts to the curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply
those intermediate circumstances and ideas, which, in his
extreme conciseness, he has thought proper to suppress.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.27"
 name="fna.vi.27" id="fna.vi.27">27</a></sup>
How Gibbon would have filled those gaps!  Though he
was seldom swayed by enthusiasm, his admiration of the
Roman historian fell little short of idolatry. His references
in &ldquo;The Decline and Fall&rdquo; are many, and some of
them are here worth recalling to mind. &ldquo;In their primitive
state of simplicity and independence,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;the Germans
were surveyed by the discerning eye and delineated
by the masterly pencil of Tacitus, the first of historians who
applied the science of philosophy to the study of facts.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.28"
 name="fna.vi.28" id="fna.vi.28">28</a></sup>
Again he speaks of him as &ldquo;the philosophic historian whose
<a name="png.125" id="png.125"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">117</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>writings will instruct the last generation of mankind.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.29"
 name="fna.vi.29" id="fna.vi.29">29</a></sup>
And in Chapter XVI he devoted five pages to citation from,
and comment on, Tacitus, and paid him one of the most
splendid tributes one historian ever paid another. &ldquo;To
collect, to dispose, and to adorn a series of fourscore years
in an immortal work, every sentence of which is pregnant
with the deepest observations and the most lively images,
was an undertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus
himself during the greatest part of his life.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.30"
 name="fna.vi.30" id="fna.vi.30">30</a></sup> So much
for admiration. That, nevertheless, Gibbon could wield the
critical pen at the expense of the historian he rated so highly,
is shown by a marginal note in his own printed copy of &ldquo;The
Decline and Fall.&rdquo; It will be remembered that Tacitus
published his History and wrote his Annals during the reign
of Trajan, whom he undoubtedly respected and admired.
He referred to the reigns of Nerva and Trajan in suggested
contrast to that of Domitian as &ldquo;times when men were
blessed with the rare privilege of thinking with freedom, and
uttering what they thought.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.31"
 name="fna.vi.31" id="fna.vi.31">31</a></sup> It fell to both Tacitus and
Gibbon to speak of the testament of Augustus which, after
his death, was read in the Senate: and Tacitus wrote, Augustus
&ldquo;added a recommendation to keep the empire within
fixed limits,&rdquo; on which he thus commented, &ldquo;but whether
from apprehension for its safety, or jealousy of future rivals,
is uncertain.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.32"
 name="fna.vi.32" id="fna.vi.32">32</a></sup> Gibbon thus criticised this comment: &ldquo;Why
must rational advice be imputed to a base or foolish motive?
To what cause, error, malevolence, or flattery, shall I ascribe
the unworthy alternative? Was the historian dazzled by
Trajan&#8217;s conquests?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.33"
 name="fna.vi.33" id="fna.vi.33">33</a></sup></p>

<p>The intellectual training of the greatest modern historian
is a matter of great interest. &ldquo;From my early youth,&rdquo;
<a name="png.126" id="png.126"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">118</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>wrote Gibbon in his Autobiography, &ldquo;I aspired to the character
of an historian.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.34"
 name="fna.vi.34" id="fna.vi.34">34</a></sup> He had &ldquo;an early and invincible
love of reading&rdquo; which he said he &ldquo;would not exchange for
the treasures of India&rdquo; and which led him to a &ldquo;vague and
multifarious&rdquo; perusal of books. Before he reached the age
of fifteen he was matriculated at Magdalen College, giving
this account of his preparation. &ldquo;I arrived at Oxford,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;with a stock of erudition that might have puzzled
a Doctor and a degree of ignorance of which a schoolboy would
have been ashamed.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.35"
 name="fna.vi.35" id="fna.vi.35">35</a></sup> He did not adapt himself to the
life or the method of Oxford, and from them apparently
derived no benefit. &ldquo;I spent fourteen months at Magdalen
College,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;they proved the fourteen months the
most idle and unprofitable of my whole life.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.36"
 name="fna.vi.36" id="fna.vi.36">36</a></sup> He became
a Roman Catholic. It was quite characteristic of this
bookish man that his conversion was effected, not by the
emotional influence of some proselytizer, but by the reading
of books. English translations of two famous works of
Bossuet fell into his hands. &ldquo;I read,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I applauded,
I believed &hellip; and I surely fell by a noble hand.&rdquo; Before
a priest in London, on June 8, 1753, he privately &ldquo;abjured
the errors of heresy&rdquo; and was admitted into the &ldquo;pale of
the church.&rdquo; But at that time this was a serious business
for both priest and proselyte. For the rule laid down by
Blackstone was this, &ldquo;Where a person is reconciled to the
see of Rome, or procures others to be reconciled, the offence
amounts to High-Treason.&rdquo; This severe rule was not enforced,
but there were milder laws under which a priest
might suffer perpetual imprisonment and the proselyte&#8217;s
estate be transferred to his nearest relations. Under such
laws prosecutions were had and convictions obtained.
Little wonder was it when Gibbon apprised his father in
<a name="png.127" id="png.127"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>an &ldquo;elaborate controversial epistle&rdquo; of the serious step
which he had taken, that the elder Gibbon should be astonished
and indignant. In his passion he divulged the
secret which effectually closed the gates of Magdalen College
to his son<sup><a href="#fn.vi.37"
 name="fna.vi.37" id="fna.vi.37">37</a></sup>, who was packed off to Lausanne and &ldquo;settled
under the roof and tuition&rdquo; of a Calvinist minister<sup><a href="#fn.vi.38"
 name="fna.vi.38" id="fna.vi.38">38</a></sup>. Edward
Gibbon passed nearly five years at Lausanne, from the
age of sixteen to that of twenty-one, and they were fruitful
years for his education. It was almost entirely an affair
of self-training, as his tutor soon perceived that the student
had gone beyond the teacher and allowed him to pursue his
own special bent. After his history was published and his
fame won, he recorded this opinion: &ldquo;In the life of every
man of letters there is an æra, from a level, from whence
he soars with his own wings to his proper height, and the
most important part of his education is that which he bestows
on himself.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.39"
 name="fna.vi.39" id="fna.vi.39">39</a></sup> This was certainly true in Gibbon&#8217;s
case. On his arrival at Lausanne he hardly knew any
French, but before he returned to England he thought spontaneously
in French and understood, spoke, and wrote it
better than he did his mother tongue.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.40"
 name="fna.vi.40" id="fna.vi.40">40</a></sup> He read Montesquieu
frequently and was struck with his &ldquo;energy of style
and boldness of hypothesis.&rdquo; Among the books which
&ldquo;may have remotely contributed to form the historian of the
Roman Empire&rdquo; were the Provincial Letters of Pascal,
which he read &ldquo;with a new pleasure&rdquo; almost every year.
From them he said, &ldquo;I learned to manage the weapon of
grave and temperate irony, even on subjects of ecclesiastical
solemnity.&rdquo; As one thinks of his chapters in &ldquo;The Decline
and Fall&rdquo; on Julian, one is interested to know that during
this period he was introduced to the life and times of this
<a name="png.128" id="png.128"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">120</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Roman emperor by a book written by a French abbé. He
read Locke, Grotius, and Puffendorf, but unquestionably his
greatest knowledge, mental discipline, and peculiar mastery
of his own tongue came from his diligent and systematic
study of the Latin classics. He read nearly all of the historians,
poets, orators, and philosophers, going over for a second
or even a third time Terence, Virgil, Horace, and Tacitus.
He mastered Cicero&#8217;s Orations and Letters so that
they became ingrained in his mental fiber, and he termed
these and his other works, &ldquo;a library of eloquence and
reason.&rdquo; &ldquo;As I read Cicero,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I applauded the
observation of Quintilian, that every student may judge
of his own proficiency by the satisfaction which he receives
from the Roman orator.&rdquo; And again, &ldquo;Cicero&#8217;s epistles
may in particular afford the models of every form of correspondence
from the careless effusions of tenderness and
friendship to the well-guarded declaration of discreet and
dignified resentment.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.41"
 name="fna.vi.41" id="fna.vi.41">41</a></sup> Gibbon never mastered Greek as
he did Latin; and Dr. Smith, one of his editors, points
out where he has fallen into three errors from the use of
the French or Latin translation of Procopius instead of
consulting the original.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.42"
 name="fna.vi.42" id="fna.vi.42">42</a></sup> Indeed he himself has disclosed
one defect of self-training. Referring to his youthful residence
at Lausanne, he wrote: &ldquo;I worked my way through
about half the Iliad, and afterwards interpreted alone a
large portion of Xenophon and Herodotus. But my ardor,
destitute of aid and emulation, was gradually cooled and,
from the barren task of searching words in a lexicon, I withdrew
to the free and familiar conversation of Virgil and
Tacitus.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.43"
 name="fna.vi.43" id="fna.vi.43">43</a></sup></p>

<p>All things considered, however, it was an excellent training
for a historian of the Roman Empire. But all except the
<a name="png.129" id="png.129"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">121</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>living knowledge of French he might have had in his &ldquo;elegant
apartment in Magdalen College&rdquo; just as well as in his
&ldquo;ill-contrived and ill-furnished small chamber&rdquo; in &ldquo;an old
inconvenient house,&rdquo; situated in a &ldquo;narrow gloomy street,
the most unfrequented of an unhandsome town&rdquo;;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.44"
 name="fna.vi.44" id="fna.vi.44">44</a></sup> and in
Oxford he would have had the &ldquo;aid and emulation&rdquo; of
which at Lausanne he sadly felt the lack.</p>

<p>The Calvinist minister, his tutor, was a more useful guide
for Gibbon in the matter of religion than in his intellectual
training. Through his efforts and Gibbon&#8217;s &ldquo;private reflections,&rdquo;
Christmas Day, 1754, one year and a half after
his arrival at Lausanne, was witness to his reconversion, as
he then received the sacrament in the Calvinistic Church.
&ldquo;The articles of the Romish creed,&rdquo; he said, had &ldquo;disappeared
like a dream&rdquo;; and he wrote home to his aunt,
&ldquo;I am now a good Protestant and am extremely glad of it.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.45"
 name="fna.vi.45" id="fna.vi.45">45</a></sup></p>

<p>An intellectual and social experience of value was his
meeting with Voltaire, who had set up a theater in the
neighborhood of Lausanne for the performance mainly of
his own plays. Gibbon seldom failed to procure a ticket to
these representations. Voltaire played the parts suited to
his years; his declamation, Gibbon thought, was old-fashioned,
and &ldquo;he expressed the enthusiasm of poetry
rather than the feelings of nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;The parts of the young
and fair,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;were distorted by Voltaire&#8217;s fat and
ugly niece.&rdquo; Despite this criticism, these performances
fostered a taste for the French theater, to the abatement of
his idolatry for Shakespeare, which seemed to him to be
&ldquo;inculcated from our infancy as the first duty of an Englishman.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.46"
 name="fna.vi.46" id="fna.vi.46">46</a></sup>
Personally, Voltaire and Gibbon did not get on
well together. Dr. Hill suggests that Voltaire may have
slighted the &ldquo;English youth,&rdquo; and if this is correct, Gibbon
<a name="png.130" id="png.130"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was somewhat spiteful to carry the feeling more than thirty
years. Besides the criticism of the acting, he called Voltaire
&ldquo;the envious bard&rdquo; because it was only with much reluctance
and ill-humor that he permitted the performance of
Iphigenie of Racine. Nevertheless, Gibbon is impressed
with the social influence of the great Frenchman. &ldquo;The
wit and philosophy of Voltaire, his table and theatre,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;refined in a visible degree the manners of Lausanne,
and however addicted to study, I enjoyed my share of the
amusements of society. After the theatrical representations,
I sometimes supped with the actors: I was now familiar
in some, and acquainted in many, houses; and my evenings
were generally devoted to cards and conversation,
either in private parties or numerous assemblies.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.47"
 name="fna.vi.47" id="fna.vi.47">47</a></sup></p>

<p>Gibbon was twenty-one when he returned to England.
Dividing his time between London and the country, he
continued his self-culture. He read English, French, and
Latin, and took up the study of Greek. &ldquo;Every day, every
hour,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;was agreeably filled&rdquo;; and &ldquo;I was never
less alone than when by myself.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.48"
 name="fna.vi.48" id="fna.vi.48">48</a></sup> He read repeatedly
Robertson and Hume, and has in the words of Sainte-Beuve
left a testimony so spirited and so delicately expressed as
could have come only from a man of taste who appreciated
Xenophon.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.49"
 name="fna.vi.49" id="fna.vi.49">49</a></sup> &ldquo;The perfect composition, the nervous language,&rdquo;
wrote Gibbon, &ldquo;the well-turned periods of Dr.
Robertson inflamed me to the ambitious hope that I might
one day tread in his footsteps; the calm philosophy, the
careless inimitable beauties of his friend and rival, often
forced me to close the volume with a mixed sensation of
delight and despair.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.50"
 name="fna.vi.50" id="fna.vi.50">50</a></sup> He made little progress in London
society and his solitary evenings were passed with his books,
<a name="png.131" id="png.131"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">123</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>but he consoled himself by thinking that he lost nothing by
a withdrawal from a &ldquo;noisy and expensive scene of crowds
without company, and dissipation without pleasure.&rdquo; At
twenty-four he published his &ldquo;Essay on the Study of Literature,&rdquo;
begun at Lausanne and written entirely in French.
This possesses no interest for the historical student except to
know the bare fact of the writing and publication as a step
in the intellectual development of the historian. Sainte-Beuve
in his two essays on Gibbon devoted three pages to
an abstract and criticism of it, perhaps because it had a
greater success in France than in England; and his opinion
of Gibbon&#8217;s language is interesting. &ldquo;The French&rdquo;
Sainte-Beuve wrote, &ldquo;is that of one who has read Montesquieu
much and imitates him; it is correct, but artificial
French.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.51"
 name="fna.vi.51" id="fna.vi.51">51</a></sup></p>

<p>Then followed two and a half years&#8217; service in the Hampshire
militia. But he did not neglect his reading. He
mastered Homer, whom he termed &ldquo;the Bible of the ancients,&rdquo;
and in the militia he acquired &ldquo;a just and indelible
knowledge&rdquo; of what he called &ldquo;the first of languages.&rdquo;
And his love for Latin abided also: &ldquo;On every march, in
every journey, Horace was always in my pocket and often
in my hand.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.52"
 name="fna.vi.52" id="fna.vi.52">52</a></sup> Practical knowledge he absorbed almost
insensibly. &ldquo;The daily occupations of the militia,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;introduced me to the science of Tactics&rdquo; and led to the
study of &ldquo;the precepts of Polybius and Cæsar.&rdquo; In this
connection occurs the remark which admirers of Gibbon
will never tire of citing: &ldquo;A familiar view of the discipline
and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer
notion of the Phalanx and the Legion; and the Captain of
the Hampshire Grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not
been useless to the historian of the decline and fall of the
<a name="png.132" id="png.132"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">124</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Roman Empire.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.53"
 name="fna.vi.53" id="fna.vi.53">53</a></sup> The grand tour followed his militia
service. Three and a half months in Paris, and a revisit to
Lausanne preceded the year that he passed in Italy. Of
the conception of the History of the Decline and Fall, during
his stay in Rome, I have already spoken.</p>

<p>On his return to England, contemplating &ldquo;the decline
and fall of Rome at an awful distance,&rdquo; he began, in collaboration
with the Swiss Deyverdun, his bosom friend, a
history of Switzerland written in French. During the winter
of 1767, the first book of it was submitted to a literary
society of foreigners in London. As the author was unknown
the strictures were free and the verdict unfavorable.
Gibbon was present at the meeting and related that &ldquo;the
momentary sensation was painful,&rdquo; but, on cooler reflection,
he agreed with his judges and intended to consign his manuscript
to the flames. But this, as Lord Sheffield, his literary
executor and first editor, shows conclusively, he neglected
to do.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.54"
 name="fna.vi.54" id="fna.vi.54">54</a></sup> This essay of Gibbon&#8217;s possesses interest for us,
inasmuch as David Hume read it, and wrote to Gibbon a
friendly letter, in which he said: &ldquo;I have perused your
manuscript with great pleasure and satisfaction. I have
only one objection, derived from the language in which it
is written. Why do you compose in French, and carry
faggots into the wood, as Horace says with regard to Romans
who wrote in Greek?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.55"
 name="fna.vi.55" id="fna.vi.55">55</a></sup> This critical query of Hume
must have profoundly influenced Gibbon. Next year he
began to work seriously on &ldquo;The Decline and Fall&rdquo; and
five years later began the composition of it in English. It
does not appear that he had any idea of writing his magnum
opus in French.</p>

<p>In this rambling discourse, in which I have purposely
avoided relating the life of Gibbon in anything like a
<a name="png.133" id="png.133"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">125</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>chronological order, we return again and again to the great
History. And it could not well be otherwise. For if
Edward Gibbon could not have proudly said, I am the author
of &ldquo;six volumes in quartos&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.56"
 name="fna.vi.56" id="fna.vi.56">56</a></sup> he would have had no
interest for us. Dr. Hill writes, &ldquo;For one reader who has
read his &lsquo;Decline and Fall,&rsquo; there are at least a score who
have read his Autobiography, and who know him, not as
the great historian, but as a man of a most original and
interesting nature.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.57"
 name="fna.vi.57" id="fna.vi.57">57</a></sup> But these twenty people would
never have looked into the Autobiography had it not been
the life of a great historian; indeed the Autobiography
would never have been written except to give an account
of a great life work. &ldquo;The Decline and Fall,&rdquo; therefore, is
the thing about which all the other incidents of his life
revolve. The longer this history is read and studied, the
greater is the appreciation of it. Dean Milman followed
Gibbon&#8217;s track through many portions of his work, and
read his authorities, ending with a deliberate judgment in
favor of his &ldquo;general accuracy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Many of his seeming
errors,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;are almost inevitable from the close
condensation of his matter.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.58"
 name="fna.vi.58" id="fna.vi.58">58</a></sup> Guizot had three different
opinions based on three various readings. After the first
rapid perusal, the dominant feeling was one of interest in a
narrative, always animated in spite of its extent, always
clear and limpid in spite of the variety of objects. During
the second reading, when he examined particularly certain
points, he was somewhat disappointed; he encountered
some errors either in the citations or in the facts and especially
shades and strokes of partiality which led him to a
comparatively rigorous judgment. In the ensuing complete
third reading, the first impression, doubtless corrected
by the second, but not destroyed, survived and was
<a name="png.134" id="png.134"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">126</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>maintained; and with some restrictions and reservations, Guizot
declared that, concerning that vast and able work, there
remained with him an appreciation of the immensity of
research, the variety of knowledge, the sagacious breadth
and especially that truly philosophical rectitude of a mind
which judges the past as it would judge the present.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.59"
 name="fna.vi.59" id="fna.vi.59">59</a></sup>
Mommsen said in 1894: &ldquo;Amid all the changes that have
come over the study of the history of the Roman Empire, in
spite of all the rush of the new evidence that has poured in
upon us and almost overwhelmed us, in spite of changes
which must be made, in spite of alterations of view, or
alterations even in the aspect of great characters, no one
would in the future be able to read the history of the Roman
Empire unless he read, possibly with a fuller knowledge,
but with the broad views, the clear insight, the strong grasp
of Edward Gibbon.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.60"
 name="fna.vi.60" id="fna.vi.60">60</a></sup></p>

<p>It is difficult for an admirer of Gibbon to refrain from
quoting some of his favorite passages. The opinion of a
great historian on history always possesses interest. History,
wrote Gibbon, is &ldquo;little more than the register of the crimes,
follies, and misfortunes of mankind.&rdquo; Again, &ldquo;Wars and
the administration of public affairs are the principal subjects
of history.&rdquo; And the following cannot fail to recall a
similar thought in Tacitus, &ldquo;History undertakes to record
the transactions of the past for the instruction of future
ages.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.61"
 name="fna.vi.61" id="fna.vi.61">61</a></sup> Two references to religion under the Pagan empire
are always worth repeating. &ldquo;The various modes of
worship which prevailed in the Roman world,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;were all considered by the people as equally true; by
the philosopher as equally false; and by the magistrate as
equally useful.&rdquo; &ldquo;The fashion of incredulity was
<a name="png.135" id="png.135"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">127</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>communicated from the philosopher to the man of pleasure or
business, from the noble to the plebeian, and from the master
to the menial slave who waited at his table and who equally
listened to the freedom of his conversation.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.62"
 name="fna.vi.62" id="fna.vi.62">62</a></sup> Gibbon&#8217;s
idea of the happiest period of mankind is interesting and
characteristic. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;a man were called to fix
the period in the history of the world during which the condition
of the human race was most happy and prosperous,
he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from
the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.63"
 name="fna.vi.63" id="fna.vi.63">63</a></sup>
This period was from <span class="smcap lc">A.D.</span> 96 to 180, covering the reigns of
Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.
Professor Carter, in a lecture in Rome in 1907, drew,
by a modern comparison, a characterization of the first
three named. When we were studying in Germany, he
said, we were accustomed to sum up the three emperors,
William I, Frederick III, and William II, as der greise
Kaiser, der weise Kaiser, und der reise Kaiser. The characterizations
will fit well Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian.
Gibbon speaks of the &ldquo;restless activity&rdquo; of Hadrian, whose
life &ldquo;was almost a perpetual journey,&rdquo; and who during his
reign visited every province of his empire.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.64"
 name="fna.vi.64" id="fna.vi.64">64</a></sup></p>

<p>A casual remark of Gibbon&#8217;s, &ldquo;Corruption [is] the most
infallible symptom of constitutional liberty,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.65"
 name="fna.vi.65" id="fna.vi.65">65</a></sup> shows the
sentiment of the eighteenth century. The generality of
the history becomes specific in a letter to his father, who
has given him hopes of a seat in Parliament. &ldquo;This seat,&rdquo;
so Edward Gibbon wrote, &ldquo;according to the custom of our
venal country was to be bought, and fifteen hundred pounds
were mentioned as the price of purchase.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.66"
 name="fna.vi.66" id="fna.vi.66">66</a></sup></p>

<p>Gibbon anticipated Captain Mahan. In speaking of a
<a name="png.136" id="png.136"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>naval battle between the fleet of Justinian and that of the
Goths in which the galleys of the Eastern empire gained a
signal victory, he wrote, &ldquo;The Goths affected to depreciate
an element in which they were unskilled; but their own
experience confirmed the truth of a maxim, that the master
of the sea will always acquire the dominion of the land.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.67"
 name="fna.vi.67" id="fna.vi.67">67</a></sup>
But Gibbon&#8217;s anticipation was one of the frequent cases
where the same idea has occurred to a number of men of
genius, as doubtless Captain Mahan was not aware of this
sentence any more than he was of Bacon&#8217;s and Raleigh&#8217;s epitomes
of the theme which he has so originally and brilliantly
treated.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.68"
 name="fna.vi.68" id="fna.vi.68">68</a></sup></p>

<p>No modern historian has been the subject of so much
critical comment as Gibbon. I do not know how it will
compare in volume with either of the similar examinations
of Thucydides and Tacitus; but the criticism is of a different
sort. The only guarantee of the honesty of Tacitus,
wrote Sainte-Beuve, is Tacitus himself;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.69"
 name="fna.vi.69" id="fna.vi.69">69</a></sup> and a like remark
will apply to Thucydides. But a fierce light beats on Gibbon.
His voluminous notes furnish the critics the materials
on which he built his history, which, in the case of
the ancient historians, must be largely a matter of conjecture.
With all the searching examination of &ldquo;The Decline
and Fall,&rdquo; it is surprising how few errors have been found
and, of the errors which have been noted, how few are really
important. Guizot, Milman, Dr. Smith, Cotter Morison,
Bury, and a number of lesser lights have raked his text and
his notes with few momentous results. We have, writes
Bury, improved methods over Gibbon and &ldquo;much new material
of various kinds,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Gibbon&#8217;s historical sense
kept him constantly right in dealing with his sources&rdquo;;
<a name="png.137" id="png.137"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">129</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and &ldquo;in the main things he is still our master.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.70"
 name="fna.vi.70" id="fna.vi.70">70</a></sup> The man
is generally reflected in his book. That Gibbon has been
weighed and not found wanting is because he was as honest
and truthful as any man who ever wrote history. The
autobiographies and letters exhibit to us a transparent
man, which indeed some of the personal allusions in the
history might have foreshadowed. &ldquo;I have often fluctuated
and shall <em>tamely</em> follow the Colbert Ms.,&rdquo; he wrote, where
the authenticity of a book was in question.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.71"
 name="fna.vi.71" id="fna.vi.71">71</a></sup> In another
case &ldquo;the scarcity of facts and the uncertainty of dates&rdquo;
opposed his attempt to describe the first invasion of Italy
by Alaric.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.72"
 name="fna.vi.72" id="fna.vi.72">72</a></sup> In the beginning of the famous Chapter
XLIV which is &ldquo;admired by jurists as a brief and brilliant
exposition of the principles of Roman law,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.73"
 name="fna.vi.73" id="fna.vi.73">73</a></sup> Gibbon wrote,
&ldquo;Attached to no party, interested only for the truth and
candor of history, and directed by the most temperate
and skillful guides, I enter with just diffidence on the subject
of civil law.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.74"
 name="fna.vi.74" id="fna.vi.74">74</a></sup> In speaking of the state of Britain
between 409 and 449, he said, &ldquo;I owe it to myself and to
historic truth to declare that some <em>circumstances</em> in this
paragraph are founded only on conjecture and analogy.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.75"
 name="fna.vi.75" id="fna.vi.75">75</a></sup>
Throughout his whole work the scarcity of materials forces
Gibbon to the frequent use of conjecture, but I believe that
for the most part his conjectures seem reasonable to the
critics. Impressed with the correctness of his account of
the Eastern empire a student of the subject once told me
that Gibbon certainly possessed the power of wise divination.</p>

<p>Gibbon&#8217;s striving after precision and accuracy is shown in
some marginal corrections he made in his own printed copy
of &ldquo;The Decline and Fall.&rdquo; On the first page in his first
<a name="png.138" id="png.138"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">130</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>printed edition and as it now stands, he said, &ldquo;To deduce
the most important circumstances of its decline and fall:
a revolution which will ever be remembered and is still
felt by the nations of the earth.&rdquo; For this the following
is substituted: &ldquo;To prosecute the decline and fall of the
empire of Rome: of whose language, religion, and laws the
impression will be long preserved in our own and the neighboring
countries of Europe.&rdquo; He thus explains the change:
&ldquo;Mr. Hume told me that, in correcting his history, he
always labored to reduce superlatives and soften positives.
Have Asia and Africa, from Japan to Morocco, any feeling
or memory of the Roman Empire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On page 6, Bury&#8217;s edition, the text is, &ldquo;The praises of
Alexander, transmitted by a succession of poets and historians,
had kindled a dangerous emulation in the mind of
Trajan.&rdquo; We can imagine that Gibbon reflected, What
evidence have I that Trajan had read these poets and historians?
Therefore he made this change: &ldquo;Late generations
and far distant climates may impute their calamities
to the immortal author of the Iliad. The spirit of Alexander
was inflamed by the praises of Achilles; and succeeding
heroes have been ambitious to tread in the footsteps
of Alexander. Like him, the Emperor Trajan aspired to
the conquest of the East.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.76"
 name="fna.vi.76" id="fna.vi.76">76</a></sup></p>

<p>The &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; to the first octavo edition published
in 1783 is an instance of Gibbon&#8217;s truthfulness. He
wrote, &ldquo;Some alterations and improvements had presented
themselves to my mind, but I was unwilling to injure or
offend the purchasers of the preceding editions.&rdquo; Then he
seems to reflect that this is not quite the whole truth and
adds, &ldquo;Perhaps I may stand excused if, amidst the avocations
of a busy winter, I have preferred the pleasures of

a former publication.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.77"
 name="fna.vi.77" id="fna.vi.77">77</a></sup></p>

<p>The severest criticism that Gibbon has received is on
his famous chapters XV and XVI which conclude his
first volume in the original quarto edition of 1776. We
may disregard the flood of contemporary criticism from
certain people who were excited by what they deemed an
attack on the Christian religion. Dean Milman, who objected
seriously to much in these chapters, consulted these
various answers to Gibbon on the first appearance of his
work with, according to his own confession, little profit.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.78"
 name="fna.vi.78" id="fna.vi.78">78</a></sup>
&ldquo;Against his celebrated fifteenth and sixteenth chapters,&rdquo;
wrote Buckle, &ldquo;all the devices of controversy have been
exhausted; but the only result has been, that while the
fame of the historian is untarnished, the attacks of his
enemies are falling into complete oblivion. The work of
Gibbon remains; but who is there who feels any interest
in what was written against him?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.79"
 name="fna.vi.79" id="fna.vi.79">79</a></sup> During the last generation,
however, criticism has taken another form and scientific
men now do not exactly share Buckle&#8217;s gleeful opinion.
Both Bury and Cotter Morison state or imply that well-grounded
exceptions may be taken to Gibbon&#8217;s treatment
of the early Christian church. He ignored some facts; his
combination of others, his inferences, his opinions are not
fair and unprejudiced. A further grave objection may be
made to the tone of these two chapters: sarcasm pervades
them and the Gibbon sneer has become an apt characterization.</p>

<p>Francis Parkman admitted that he was a reverent agnostic,
and if Gibbon had been a reverent free-thinker these
two chapters would have been far different in tone. Lecky
<a name="png.140" id="png.140"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">132</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>regarded the Christian church as a great institution worthy
of reverence and respect although he stated the central
thesis of Gibbon with emphasis just as great. Of the conversion
of the Roman Empire to Christianity, Lecky wrote,
&ldquo;it may be boldly asserted that the assumption of a moral
or intellectual miracle is utterly gratuitous. Never before
was a religious transformation so manifestly inevitable.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.80"
 name="fna.vi.80" id="fna.vi.80">80</a></sup>
Gibbon&#8217;s sneering tone was a characteristic of his time.
There existed during the latter part of the eighteenth century,
wrote Sir James Mackintosh, &ldquo;an unphilosophical
and indeed fanatical animosity against Christianity.&rdquo; But
Gibbon&#8217;s private defense is entitled to consideration as
placing him in a better light. &ldquo;The primitive church, which
I have treated with some freedom,&rdquo; he wrote to Lord Sheffield
in 1791, &ldquo;was itself at that time an innovation, and
I was attached to the old Pagan establishment.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.81"
 name="fna.vi.81" id="fna.vi.81">81</a></sup> &ldquo;Had I
believed,&rdquo; he said in his Autobiography, &ldquo;that the majority
of English readers were so fondly attached to the
name and shadow of Christianity, had I foreseen that the
pious, the timid, and the prudent would feel, or affect to
feel, with such exquisite sensibility, I might perhaps have
softened the two invidious chapters.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.82"
 name="fna.vi.82" id="fna.vi.82">82</a></sup></p>

<p>On the other hand Gibbon&#8217;s treatment of Julian the Apostate
is in accordance with the best modern standard. It
might have been supposed that a quasi-Pagan, as he avowed
himself, would have emphasized Julian&#8217;s virtues and ignored
his weaknesses as did Voltaire, who invested him with
all the good qualities of Trajan, Cato, and Julius Cæsar, without
their defects.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.83"
 name="fna.vi.83" id="fna.vi.83">83</a></sup> Robertson indeed feared that he might
fail in this part of the history;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.84"
 name="fna.vi.84" id="fna.vi.84">84</a></sup> but Gibbon weighed Julian
in the balance, duly estimating his strength and his
<a name="png.141" id="png.141"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">133</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>weakness, with the result that he has given a clear and just
account in his best and most dignified style.<sup><a href="#fn.vi.85"
 name="fna.vi.85" id="fna.vi.85">85</a></sup></p>

<p>Gibbon&#8217;s treatment of Theodora, the wife of Justinian, is
certainly open to objection. Without proper sifting and a
reasonable skepticism, he has incorporated into his narrative
the questionable account with all its salacious details
which Procopius gives in his Secret History, Gibbon&#8217;s
love of a scandalous tale getting the better of his historical
criticism. He has not neglected to urge a defense. &ldquo;I am
justified,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;in painting the manners of the times;
the vices of Theodora form an essential feature in the
reign and character of Justinian&hellip;. My English text is
chaste, and all licentious passages are left in the obscurity
of a learned language.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.86"
 name="fna.vi.86" id="fna.vi.86">86</a></sup> This explanation satisfies neither
Cotter Morison nor Bury, nor would it hold for a moment as
a justification of a historian of our own day. Gibbon is
really so scientific, so much like a late nineteenth-century
man, that we do right to subject him to our present-day
rigid tests.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion about Gibbon&#8217;s style,
which we all know is pompous and Latinized. On a long
reading his rounded and sonorous periods become wearisome,
and one wishes that occasionally a sentence would
terminate with a small word, even a preposition. One
feels as did Dickens after walking for an hour or two about
the handsome but &ldquo;distractingly regular&rdquo; city of Philadelphia.
&ldquo;I felt,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;that I would have given
the world for a crooked street.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.87"
 name="fna.vi.87" id="fna.vi.87">87</a></sup> Despite the pomposity,
Gibbon&#8217;s style is correct, and the exact use of words is a
marvel. It is rare, I think, that any substitution or change
of words will improve upon the precision of the text. His
<a name="png.142" id="png.142"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">134</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>compression and selection of salient points are remarkable.
Amid some commonplace philosophy he frequently rises
to a generalization as brilliant as it is truthful. Then, too,
one is impressed with the dignity of history; one feels that
Gibbon looked upon his work as very serious, and thought
with Thucydides, &ldquo;My history is an everlasting possession,
not a prize composition which is heard and forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To a writer of history few things are more interesting than
a great historian&#8217;s autobiographical remarks which relate
to the composition of his work. &ldquo;Had I been more indigent
or more wealthy,&rdquo; wrote Gibbon in his Autobiography,
&ldquo;I should not have possessed the leisure or the perseverance
to prepare and execute my voluminous history.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.88"
 name="fna.vi.88" id="fna.vi.88">88</a></sup> &ldquo;Notwithstanding
the hurry of business and pleasure,&rdquo; he wrote
from London in 1778, &ldquo;I steal some moments for the Roman
Empire.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.89"
 name="fna.vi.89" id="fna.vi.89">89</a></sup> Between the writing of the first three and the
last three volumes, he took a rest of &ldquo;near a twelvemonth&rdquo;
and gave expression to a thought which may be echoed by
every studious writer, &ldquo;Yet in the luxury of freedom, I
began to wish for the daily task, the active pursuit which
gave a value to every book and an object to every inquiry.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.90"
 name="fna.vi.90" id="fna.vi.90">90</a></sup>
Every one who has written a historical book will sympathize
with the following expression of personal experience as he approached
the completion of &ldquo;The Decline and Fall&rdquo;: &ldquo;Let no
man who builds a house or writes a book presume to say when
he will have finished. When he imagines that he is drawing
near to his journey&#8217;s end, Alps rise on Alps, and he continually
finds something to add and something to correct.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.91"
 name="fna.vi.91" id="fna.vi.91">91</a></sup></p>

<p>Plain truthful tales are Gibbon&#8217;s autobiographies. The
style is that of the history, and he writes of himself as frankly
as he does of any of his historical characters. His
<a name="png.143" id="png.143"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">135</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>failings&mdash;what he has somewhere termed &ldquo;the amiable weaknesses
of human nature&rdquo;&mdash;are disclosed with the openness
of a Frenchman. All but one of the ten years between 1783
and 1793, between the ages of 46 and 56, he passed at Lausanne.
There he completed &ldquo;The Decline and Fall,&rdquo; and of
that period he spent from August, 1787, to July, 1788, in
England to look after the publication of the last three volumes.
His life in Lausanne was one of study, writing, and
agreeable society, of which his correspondence with his
English friends gives an animated account. The two
things one is most impressed with are his love for books
and his love for Madeira. &ldquo;Though a lover of society,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;my library is the room to which I am most attached.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.92"
 name="fna.vi.92" id="fna.vi.92">92</a></sup>
While getting settled at Lausanne, he complains
that his boxes of books &ldquo;loiter on the road.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.93"
 name="fna.vi.93" id="fna.vi.93">93</a></sup> And
then he harps on another string. &ldquo;Good Madeira,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;is now become essential to my health and reputation;&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.94"
 name="fna.vi.94" id="fna.vi.94">94</a></sup>
yet again, &ldquo;If I do not receive a supply of Madeira
in the course of the summer, I shall be in great shame and
distress.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.95"
 name="fna.vi.95" id="fna.vi.95">95</a></sup> His good friend in England, Lord Sheffield,
regarded his prayer and sent him a hogshead of &ldquo;best old
Madeira&rdquo; and a tierce, containing six dozen bottles of &ldquo;finest
Malmsey,&rdquo; and at the same time wrote: <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original has &lsquo;You">&ldquo;You</ins> will remember
that a hogshead is on his travels through the torrid zone for
you&hellip;. No wine is meliorated to a greater degree by
keeping than Madeira, and you latterly appeared so ravenous
for it, that I must conceive you wish to have a stock.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.96"
 name="fna.vi.96" id="fna.vi.96">96</a></sup>
Gibbon&#8217;s devotion to Madeira bore its penalty. At the age
of forty-eight he sent this account to his stepmother: &ldquo;I
was in hopes that my old Enemy the Gout had given over
the attack, but the Villain, with his ally the winter,
<a name="png.144" id="png.144"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">136</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>convinced me of my error, and about the latter end of March I
found myself a prisoner in my library and my great chair.
I attempted twice to rise, he twice knocked me down again
and kept possession of both my feet and knees longer (I
must confess) than he ever had done before.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.97"
 name="fna.vi.97" id="fna.vi.97">97</a></sup> Eager to
finish his history, he lamented that his &ldquo;long gout&rdquo; lost him
&ldquo;three months in the spring.&rdquo; Thus as you go through his
correspondence, you find that orders for Madeira and attacks
of gout alternate with regularity. Gibbon apparently
did not connect the two as cause and effect, as in his
autobiography he charged his malady to his service in the
Hampshire militia, when &ldquo;the daily practice of hard and
even excessive drinking&rdquo; had sown in his constitution
&ldquo;the seeds of the gout.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.98"
 name="fna.vi.98" id="fna.vi.98">98</a></sup></p>

<p>Gibbon has never been a favorite with women, owing
largely to his account of his early love affair. While at
Lausanne, he had heard much of &ldquo;the wit and beauty and
erudition of Mademoiselle Curchod&rdquo; and when he first met
her, he had reached the age of twenty. &ldquo;I saw and loved,&rdquo;
he wrote. &ldquo;I found her learned without pedantry, lively
in conversation, pure in sentiment, and elegant in manners&hellip;.
She listened to the voice of truth and passion&hellip;.
At Lausanne I indulged my dream of felicity&rdquo;; and indeed
he appeared to be an ardent lover. &ldquo;He was seen,&rdquo; said a
contemporary, &ldquo;stopping country people near Lausanne
and demanding at the point of a naked dagger whether a
more adorable creature existed than Suzanne Curchod.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.99"
 name="fna.vi.99" id="fna.vi.99">99</a></sup>
On his return to England, however, he soon discovered that
his father would not hear of this alliance, and he thus related
the sequence: &ldquo;After a painful struggle, I yielded to my
fate&hellip;. I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.100"
 name="fna.vi.100" id="fna.vi.100">100</a></sup> From
<a name="png.145" id="png.145"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">137</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>England he wrote to Mademoiselle Curchod breaking off the
engagement. Perhaps it is because of feminine criticism
that Cotter Morison indulges in an elaborate defense of Gibbon,
which indeed hardly seems necessary. Rousseau, who
was privy to the love affair, said that &ldquo;Gibbon was too cold-blooded
a young man for his taste or for Mademoiselle
Curchod&#8217;s happiness.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.101"
 name="fna.vi.101" id="fna.vi.101">101</a></sup> Mademoiselle Curchod a few years
later married Necker, a rich Paris banker, who under Louis
XVI held the office of director-general of the finances. She
was the mother of Madame de Staël, was a leader of the
literary society in Paris and, despite the troublous times,
must have led a happy life. One delightful aspect of the
story is the warm friendship that existed between Madame
Necker and Edward Gibbon. This began less than a year
after her marriage. &ldquo;The Curchod (Madame Necker) I
saw at Paris,&rdquo; he wrote to his friend Holroyd. &ldquo;She was
very fond of me and the husband particularly civil. Could
they insult me more cruelly? Ask me every evening to
supper; go to bed, and leave me alone with his wife&mdash;what
an impertinent security!&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.102"
 name="fna.vi.102" id="fna.vi.102">102</a></sup></p>

<p>If women read the Correspondence as they do the Autobiography,
I think that their aversion to the great historian
would be increased by these confiding words to his stepmother,
written when he was forty-nine: &ldquo;The habits of
female conversation have sometimes tempted me to acquire
the piece of furniture, a wife, and could I unite in a single
Woman the virtues and accomplishments of half a dozen
<a name="png.146" id="png.146"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">138</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of my acquaintance, I would instantly pay my addresses
to the Constellation.&rdquo; <sup><a href="#fn.vi.103"
 name="fna.vi.103" id="fna.vi.103">103</a></sup></p>

<p>I have always been impressed with Gibbon&#8217;s pride at
being the author of &ldquo;six volumes in quartos&rdquo;; but as nearly
all histories now are published in octavo, I had not a distinct
idea of the appearance of a quarto volume until the preparation
of this essay led me to look at different editions of Gibbon
in the Boston Athenæum. There I found the quartos,
the first volume of which is the third edition, published in
1777 [it will be remembered that the original publication
of the first volume was in February, 1776]. The volume
is 11¼ inches long by 9 inches wide and is much heavier than
our very heavy octavo volumes. With this volume in my
hand I could appreciate the remark of the Duke of Gloucester
when Gibbon brought him the second volume of the
&ldquo;Decline and Fall.&rdquo; Laying the quarto on the table he
said, &ldquo;Another d&mdash;d thick square book! Always scribble,
scribble, scribble! Eh! Mr. Gibbon?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.104"
 name="fna.vi.104" id="fna.vi.104">104</a></sup></p>

<p>During my researches at the Athenæum, I found an octavo
edition, the first volume of which was published in 1791,
and on the cover was written, &ldquo;Given to the Athenæum by
Charles Cabot. Received December 10, 1807.&rdquo; This was
the year of the foundation of the Athenæum. On the quarto
of 1777 there was no indication, but the scholarly cataloguer
informed me that it was probably also received in 1807.
Three later editions than these two are in this library, the
last of which is Bury&#8217;s of 1900 to which I have constantly
referred. Meditating in the quiet alcove, with the two
early editions of Gibbon before me, I found an answer to
the comment of H.&nbsp;G. Wells in his book &ldquo;The Future in
America&rdquo; which I confess had somewhat irritated me.
Thus wrote Wells: &ldquo;Frankly I grieve over Boston as a
<a name="png.147" id="png.147"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">139</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>great waste of leisure and energy, as a frittering away of
moral and intellectual possibilities. We give too much to
the past&hellip;. We are obsessed by the scholastic prestige
of mere knowledge and genteel remoteness.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.105"
 name="fna.vi.105" id="fna.vi.105">105</a></sup> Pondering
this iconoclastic utterance, how delightful it is to light upon
evidence in the way of well-worn volumes that, since 1807,
men and women here have been carefully reading Gibbon,
who, as Dean Milman said, &ldquo;has bridged the abyss between
ancient and modern times and connected together the two
worlds of history.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.106"
 name="fna.vi.106" id="fna.vi.106">106</a></sup> A knowledge of &ldquo;The Decline and
Fall&rdquo; is a basis for the study of all other history; it is a
mental discipline, and a training for the problems of modern
life. These Athenæum readers did not waste their leisure,
did not give too much to the past. They were supremely
right to take account of the scholastic prestige of Gibbon,
and to endeavor to make part of their mental fiber this
greatest history of modern times.</p>

<p>I will close with a quotation from the Autobiography,
which in its sincerity and absolute freedom from literary
cant will be cherished by all whose desire is to behold &ldquo;the
bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful
studies.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have drawn a high prize in the lottery
of life,&rdquo; wrote Gibbon. &ldquo;I am disgusted with the affectation
of men of letters, who complain that they have renounced
a substance for a shadow and that their fame
affords a poor compensation for envy, censure, and persecution.
My own experience at least has taught me a very
different lesson: twenty happy years have been animated
by the labor of my history; and its success has given me a
name, a rank, a character in the world, to which I should
not otherwise have been entitled&hellip;. D&#8217;Alembert relates
that as he was walking in the gardens of Sans-souci
<a name="png.148" id="png.148"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">140</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with the King of Prussia, Frederick said to him, &lsquo;Do you
see that old woman, a poor weeder, asleep on that sunny
bank? She is probably a more happy Being than either of
<span class="rthinsp">us.&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; Now the comment of Gibbon: &ldquo;The King and the
Philosopher may speak for themselves; for my part I do
not envy the old woman.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vi.107"

<h2><a name="png.151" id="png.151"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 /></span>SAMUEL RAWSON GARDINER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is my purpose to say a word of Samuel Rawson Gardiner,
the English historian, who died February 23, 1902,
and who in his research and manner of statement represents
fitly the scientific school of historical writers. He
was thorough in his investigation, sparing neither labor nor
pains to get at the truth. It may well enough be true that
the designedly untruthful historian, like the undevout astronomer,
is an anomaly, for inaccuracy comes not from
purpose, but from neglect. Now Gardiner went to the bottom
of things, and was not satisfied until he had compassed
all the material within his reach. As a matter of course he
read many languages. Whether his facts were in Spanish,
Italian, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, or English made
apparently no difference. Nor did he stop at what was in
plain language. He read a diary written chiefly in symbols,
and many letters in cipher. A large part of his material
was in manuscript, which entailed greater labor than if it
had been in print. As one reads the prefaces to his various
volumes and his footnotes, amazement is the word to express
the feeling that a man could have accomplished so
much in forty-seven years. One feels that there is no one-sided
use of any material. The Spanish, the Venetian, the
French, the Dutch nowhere displaces the English. In
Froude&#8217;s Elizabeth one gets the impression that the Simancas
manuscripts furnish a disproportionate basis of the
narrative; in Ranke&#8217;s England, that the story is made up
too much from the Venetian archives. Gardiner himself
copied many Simancas manuscripts in Spain, and he studied
<a name="png.152" id="png.152"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">144</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the archives in Venice, Paris, Brussels, and Rome, but these,
and all the other great mass of foreign material, are kept
adjunctive to that found in his own land. My impression
from a study of his volumes is that more than half of his
material is in manuscript, but because he has matter which
no one else had ever used, he does not neglect the printed
pages open to every one. To form &ldquo;a judgment on the
character and aims of Cromwell,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;it is absolutely
necessary to take Carlyle&#8217;s monumental work as a starting
point;&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vii.1" name="fna.vii.1" id="fna.vii.1">1</a></sup> yet, distrusting Carlyle&#8217;s printed transcripts, he
goes back to the original speeches and letters themselves.
Carlyle, he says, &ldquo;amends the text without warning&rdquo; in
many places; these emendations Gardiner corrects, and
out of the abundance of his learning he stops a moment to
show how Carlyle has misled the learned Dr. Murray in
attributing to Cromwell the use of the word &ldquo;communicative&rdquo;
in its modern meaning, when it was on the contrary
employed in what is now an obsolete sense.<sup><a href="#fn.vii.2" name="fna.vii.2" id="fna.vii.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Gardiner&#8217;s great work is the History of England from
1603 to 1656. In the revised editions there are ten volumes
called the &ldquo;History of England, from the Accession of
James I to the Outbreak of the Civil War,&rdquo; and four
volumes on the Great Civil War. Since this revision he has
published three volumes on the History of the Commonwealth
and the Protectorate. He was also the author of a
number of smaller volumes, a contributor to the Encyclopædia
Britannica and the Dictionary of National Biography,
and for ten years editor-in-chief of the <cite>English
Historical Review</cite>.</p>

<p>I know not which is the more remarkable, the learning,
accuracy, and diligence of the man, or withal his modesty.
<a name="png.153" id="png.153"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">145</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>With his great store of knowledge, the very truthfulness of
his soul impels him to be forward in admitting his own mistakes.
Lowell said in 1878 that Darwin was &ldquo;almost the
only perfectly disinterested lover of truth&rdquo; he had ever
encountered. Had Lowell known the historian as we know
him, he would have placed Gardiner upon the same elevation.
In the preface to the revised ten-volume edition he
alludes to the &ldquo;defects&rdquo; of his work. &ldquo;Much material,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;has accumulated since the early volumes were
published, and my own point of view is not quite the same
as it was when I started with the first years of James&nbsp;I.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vii.3"
 name="fna.vii.3" id="fna.vii.3">3</a></sup>
The most important contribution to this portion of his
period had been Spedding&#8217;s edition of Bacon&#8217;s Letters and
Life. In a note to page 208 of his second volume he tells
how Spedding&#8217;s arguments have caused him to modify
some of his statements, although the two regard the history
of the seventeenth century differently. Writing this soon
after the death of Spedding, to which he refers as &ldquo;the loss
of one whose mind was so acute and whose nature was so
patient and kindly,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;It was a true pleasure to
have one&#8217;s statements and arguments exposed to the testing
fire of his hostile criticism.&rdquo; Having pointed out later some
inaccuracies in the work of Professor Masson, he accuses
himself. &ldquo;I have little doubt,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that if my work
were subjected to as careful a revision, it would yield a far
greater crop of errors.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vii.4" name="fna.vii.4"
 id="fna.vii.4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Gardiner was born in 1829. Soon after he was twenty-six
years old he conceived the idea of writing the history of
England from the accession of James I to the restoration of
Charles II. It was a noble conception, but his means were
small. Having married, as his first wife, the youngest
daughter of Edward Irving, the enthusiastic founder of the
<a name="png.154" id="png.154"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">146</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Catholic Apostolic Church, he became an Irvingite. Because
he was an Irvingite, his university,&mdash;he was a son of
Oxford,&mdash;so it is commonly said, would give him no position
whereby he might gain his living. Nevertheless, Gardiner
studied and toiled, and in 1863 published two volumes
entitled &ldquo;A History of England from the Accession of James
I to the Disgrace of Chief Justice Coke.&rdquo; Of this work only
one hundred and forty copies were sold. Still he struggled
on. In 1869 two volumes called &ldquo;Prince Charles and the
Spanish Marriage&rdquo; were published and sold five hundred
copies. Six years later appeared two volumes entitled
&ldquo;A History of England under the Duke of Buckingham and
Charles I.&rdquo; This installment paid expenses, but no profit.
One is reminded of what Carlyle said about the pecuniary
rewards of literary men in England: &ldquo;Homer&#8217;s Iliad would
have brought the author, had he offered it to Mr. Murray
on the half-profit system, say five-and-twenty guineas.
The Prophecies of Isaiah would have made a small article
in a review which &hellip; could cheerfully enough have remunerated
him with a five-pound note.&rdquo; The first book
from which Gardiner received any money was a little volume
for the Epochs of Modern History Series on the Thirty
Years&#8217; War, published in 1874. Two more installments of
the history appearing in 1877 and 1881 made up the first
edition of what is now our ten-volume history, but in the
meantime some of the volumes went out of print. It was
not until 1883, the year of the publication of the revised
edition, that the value of his labors was generally recognized.
During this twenty-eight years, from the age of twenty-six
to fifty-four, Gardiner had his living to earn. He might
have recalled the remark made, I think, by either Goldsmith
or Lamb, that the books which will live are not those by
which we ourselves can live. Therefore Gardiner got his
<a name="png.155" id="png.155"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">147</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>bread by teaching. He became a professor in King&#8217;s College,
London, and he lectured on history for the London
Society for the Extension of University Teaching, having
large audiences all over London, and being well appreciated
in the East End. He wrote schoolbooks on history.
Finally success came twenty-eight years after his glorious
conception, twenty years after the publication of his first
volume. He had had a hard struggle for a living with money
coming in by driblets. Bread won in such a way is come
by hard, yet he remained true to his ideal. His potboilers
were good and honest books; his brief history on the Thirty
Years&#8217; War has received the praise of scholars. Recognition
brought him money rewards. In 1882 Mr. Gladstone bestowed
upon him a civil list pension of £150 a year. Two
years later All Souls College, Oxford, elected him to a research
fellowship; when this expired Merton made him a
fellow. Academic honors came late. Not until 1884, when
he was fifty-five, did he take his degree of M.A. Edinburgh
conferred upon him an LL.D., and Göttingen a Ph.D.; but
he was sixty-six when he received the coveted D.C.L. from
his own university. The year previous Lord Rosebery
offered him the Regius Professorship of History at Oxford,
but he declined it because the prosecution of his great
work required him to be near the British Museum. It is
worthy of mention that in 1874, nine years before he was
generally appreciated in England, the Massachusetts Historical
Society elected him a corresponding member.<sup><a href="#fn.vii.5"
 name="fna.vii.5" id="fna.vii.5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>During the latter part of his life Gardiner resided in the
country near London, whence it took him about an hour to
reach the British Museum, where he did his work. He
labored on his history from eleven o&#8217;clock to half-past four,
with an intermission of half an hour for luncheon. He did
<a name="png.156" id="png.156"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">148</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>not dictate to a stenographer, but wrote everything out.
Totally unaccustomed to collaboration, he never employed
a secretary or assistant of any kind. In his evenings he
did no serious labor; he spent them with his family, attended
to his correspondence, or read a novel. Thus he wrought
five hours daily. What a brain, and what a splendid training
he had given himself to accomplish such results in so
short a working day!</p>

<p>In the preface to his first volume of the &ldquo;History of the
Commonwealth,&rdquo; published in 1894, Gardiner said that he
was &ldquo;entering upon the third and last stage of a task the
accomplishment of which seemed to me many years ago to
be within the bounds of possibility.&rdquo; One more volume
bringing the history down to the death of Cromwell would
have completed the work, and then Mr. Charles H. Firth,
a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, was to take up the story.
Firth now purposes to begin his narrative with the year 1656.
Gardiner&#8217;s mantle has fallen on worthy shoulders.</p>

<p>Where historical scholars congregate in England and
America, Gardiner is highly esteemed. But the critics
must have their day. They cannot attack him for lack of
diligence and accuracy, which according to Gibbon, the
master of us all, are the prime requisites of a historian, so
they assert that he was deficient in literary style, he had no
dramatic power, his work is not interesting and will not live.
Gardiner is the product solely of the university and the
library. You may visualize him at Oxford, in the British
Museum, or at work in the archives on the Continent, but
of affairs and of society by personal contact he knew nothing.
In short, he was not a man of the world, and the histories
must be written, so these critics aver, by those who have an
actual knowledge by experience of their fellow-men. It is
profitable to examine these dicta by the light of concrete
<a name="png.157" id="png.157"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">149</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>examples. Froude saw much of society, and was a man of
the world. He wrote six volumes on the reign of Elizabeth,
from which we get the distinct impression that the dominant
characteristics of Elizabeth were meanness, vacillation,
selfishness, and cruelty. Gardiner in an introductory chapter
of forty-three pages restores to us the great queen of
Shakespeare, who brought upon her land &ldquo;a thousand,
thousand blessings.&rdquo; She loved her people well, he writes,
and ruled them wisely. She &ldquo;cleared the way for liberty,
though she understood it not.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vii.6"
 name="fna.vii.6" id="fna.vii.6">6</a></sup> Elsewhere he speaks of
&ldquo;her high spirit and enlightened judgment.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vii.7"
 name="fna.vii.7" id="fna.vii.7">7</a></sup> The writer
who has spent his life in the library among dusty archives
estimates the great ruler more correctly than the man of
the world. We all know Macaulay, a member of Parliament,
a member of the Supreme Council of India, a cabinet
minister, a historian of great merit, a brilliant man of letters.
In such a one, according to the principles laid down by
these critics, we should expect to find a supreme judge of
men. Macaulay in his essays and the first chapter of the
History painted Wentworth and Laud in the very blackest
of colors, which &ldquo;had burned themselves into the heart
of the people of England.&rdquo; Gardiner came. Wentworth
and Laud, he wrote, were controlled by a &ldquo;noble ambition,&rdquo;
which was &ldquo;not stained with personal selfishness or greed.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vii.8"
 name="fna.vii.8" id="fna.vii.8">8</a></sup>
&ldquo;England may well be proud of possessing in Wentworth a
nobler if a less practical statesman than Richelieu, of the
type to which the great cardinal belonged.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vii.9"
 name="fna.vii.9" id="fna.vii.9">9</a></sup> Again Wentworth
was &ldquo;the high-minded, masterful statesman, erring
gravely through defects of temper and knowledge.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.vii.10"
 name="fna.vii.10" id="fna.vii.10">10</a></sup> From
Macaulay we carry away the impression that Wentworth was
very wicked and that Cromwell was very good. Gardiner
<a name="png.158" id="png.158"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">150</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>loved Cromwell not less than did Macaulay, but thus he
speaks of his government: &ldquo;Step by step the government
of the Commonwealth was compelled &hellip; to rule by
means which every one of its members would have condemned
if they had been employed by Charles or Wentworth.&rdquo;
Is it not a triumph for the bookish man that in
his estimate of Wentworth and Laud he has with him the
consensus of the historical scholars of England?</p>

<p>What a change there has been in English opinion of Cromwell
in the last half century! Unquestionably that is due
to Carlyle more than to any other one man, but there might
have been a reaction from the conception of the hero worshiper
had it not been supported and somewhat modified
by so careful and impartial a student as Gardiner.</p>

<p>The alteration of sentiment toward Wentworth and Laud
is principally due to Gardiner, that toward Cromwell is
due to him in part. These are two of the striking results,
but they are only two of many things we see differently because
of the single-minded devotion of this great historian.
We know the history in England from 1603 to 1656 better
than we do that of any other period of the world; and for
this we are indebted mainly to Samuel Rawson Gardiner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amazement</span> was the feeling of the reading world on learning
that the author of the History of Rationalism was
only twenty-seven, and the writer of the History of European
Morals only thirty-one. The sentiment was that a
prodigy of learning had appeared, and a perusal of these
works now renders comprehensible the contemporary astonishment.
The Morals (published in 1869) is the better
book of the two, and, if I may judge from my own personal
experience, it may be read with delight when young,
and re-read with respect and advantage at an age when the
enthusiasms of youth have given way to the critical attitude
of experience. Grant all the critics say of it, that the reasoning
by which Lecky attempts to demolish the utilitarian
theory of morals is no longer of value, and that it lacks the
consistency of either the orthodox or the agnostic, that there
is no new historical light, and that much of the treatise is
commonplace, nevertheless the historical illustrations and
disquisitions, the fresh combination of well-known facts are
valuable for instruction and for a new point of view. His
analysis of the causes of the decline and fall of the Roman
Empire is drawn, of course, from Gibbon, but I have met
those who prefer the interesting story of Lecky to the majestic
sweep of the great master. Much less brilliant than
Buckle&#8217;s &ldquo;History of Civilization,&rdquo; the first volume of which
appeared twelve years earlier, the Morals has stood better
the test of time.</p>

<p>The intellectual biography of so precocious a writer is
interesting, and fortunately it has been related by Lecky
<a name="png.162" id="png.162"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">154</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>himself. When he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1856,
&ldquo;Mill was in the zenith of his fame and influence&rdquo;; Hugh
Miller was attempting to reconcile the recent discoveries
of geology with the Mosaic cosmogony. &ldquo;In poetry,&rdquo; wrote
Lecky, &ldquo;Tennyson and Longfellow reigned, I think with an
approach to equality which has not continued.&rdquo; In government
the orthodox political economists furnished the
theory and the Manchester school the practice. All this
intellectual fermentation affected this inquiring young
student; but at first Bishop Butler&#8217;s Analogy and sermons,
which were then much studied at Dublin, had the
paramount influence. Of the living men, Archbishop
Whately, then at Dublin, held sway. Other writers whom
he mastered were Coleridge, Newman, and Emerson, Pascal,
Bossuet, Rousseau, and Voltaire, Dugald Stewart, and Mill.
In 1857 Buckle burst upon the world, and proved a stimulus
to Lecky as well as to most serious historical students. The
result of these studies, Lecky relates, was his History of
Rationalism, published in the early part of 1865.</p>

<p>The claim made by many of Lecky&#8217;s admirers, that he
was a philosophic historian, as distinct from literary historians
like Carlyle and Macaulay, and scientific like Stubbs
and Gardiner, has injured him in the eyes of many historical
students who believe that if there be such a thing as the
philosophy of history the narrative ought to carry it naturally.
To interrupt the relation of events or the delineation
of character with parading of trite reflections or with
rashly broad generalizations is neither science nor art.
Lecky has sometimes been condemned by students who,
revolting at the term &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; in connection with
history, have failed to read his greatest work, the &ldquo;History
of England in the Eighteenth Century.&rdquo; This is a decided
advance on the History of Morals, and shows honest
<a name="png.163" id="png.163"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">155</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>investigation in original material, much of it manuscript,
and an excellent power of generalization widely different
from that which exhibits itself in a paltry philosophy.
These volumes are a real contribution to historical knowledge.
Parts of them which I like often to recur to are the
account of the ministry of Walpole, the treatment of &ldquo;parliamentary
corruption,&rdquo; of the condition of London, and
of &ldquo;national tastes and manners.&rdquo; His Chapter IX, which
relates the rise of Methodism, has a peculiarly attractive
swing and go, and his use of anecdote is effective.</p>

<p>Chapter XX, on the &ldquo;Causes of the French Revolution,&rdquo;
covering one hundred and forty-one pages, is an ambitious
effort, but it shows a thorough digestion of his material,
profound reflection, and a lively presentation of his view.
Mr. Morse Stephens believes that it is idle to attempt to inquire
into the causes of this political and social overturn.
If a historian tells the <em>how</em>, he asserts he should not be asked
to tell the <em>why</em>. This is an epigrammatic statement of a
tenet of the scientific historical school of Oxford, but men
will always be interested in inquiring why the French Revolution
happened, and such chapters as this of Lecky, a blending
of speculation and narrative, will hold their place.
These volumes have much well and impartially written
Irish history, and being published between 1878 and 1890,
at the time when the Irish question in its various forms
became acute, they attracted considerable attention from
the political world. Gladstone was an admirer of Lecky,
and said in a chat with John Morley: &ldquo;Lecky has real insight
into the motives of statesmen. Now Carlyle, so mighty as
he is in flash and penetration, has no eye for motives. Macaulay,
too, is so caught by a picture, by color, by surface,
that he is seldom to be counted on for just account of
motive.&rdquo; The Irish chapters furnished arguments for the
<a name="png.164" id="png.164"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">156</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Liberals, but did not convert Lecky himself to the policy of
home rule. When Gladstone and his party adopted it, he
became a Liberal Unionist, and as such was elected in 1895
a member of the House of Commons by Dublin University.
In view of the many comments that he was not successful
in parliamentary life, I may say that the election not only
came to him unsought, but that he recognized that he was
too old to adapt himself to the atmosphere of the House of
Commons; he accepted the position in the belief which was
pressed upon him by many friends that he could in Parliament
be useful to the University.</p>

<p>Within less than three years have we commemorated in this
hall three great English historians&mdash;Stubbs, Gardiner, and
Lecky. The one we honor to-day was the most popular of
the three. Not studied so much at the seats of learning,
he is better known to journalists, to statesmen, to men of
affairs, in short to general readers. Even our Society made
him an honorary member fourteen years before it so honored
Gardiner, although Gardiner was the older man and two
volumes of his history had been published before Lecky&#8217;s
Rationalism, and two volumes more in the same year as
the Morals. One year after it was published, Rationalism
went into a third edition. Gardiner&#8217;s first volumes
sold one hundred and forty copies. It must, however, be
stated that the Society recognized Gardiner&#8217;s work as early
as 1874 by electing him a corresponding member.</p>

<p>It is difficult to guess how long Lecky will be read. His
popularity is distinct. He was the rare combination of a
scholar and a man of the world, made so by his own peculiar
talent and by lucky opportunities. He was not obliged to
earn his living. In early life, by intimate personal intercourse,
he drew intellectual inspiration from Dean Milman,
and later he learned practical politics through his friendship
<a name="png.165" id="png.165"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">157</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with Lord Russell. He knew well Herbert Spencer, Huxley,
and Tyndall. In private conversation he was a very interesting
man. His discourse ran on books and on men; he
turned from one to the other and mixed up the two with a
ready familiarity. He went much into London society, and
though entirely serious and without having, so far as I
know, a gleam of humor, he was a fluent and entertaining
talker.</p>

<p>Mr. Lecky was vitally interested in the affairs of this country,
and sympathized with the North during our Civil War.
He once wrote to me: &ldquo;I am old enough to remember
vividly your great war, and was then much with an American
friend&mdash;a very clever lawyer named George Bemis&mdash;whom
I came to know very well at Rome&hellip;. I was myself a
decided Northerner, but the &lsquo;right of revolution&rsquo; was always
rather a stumbling block.&rdquo; Talking with Mr. Lecky in
1895, not long after the judgment of the United States Supreme
Court that the income tax was unconstitutional, he
expressed the opinion that it was a grand decision, evidencing
a high respect for private property, but in the next
breath came the question, &ldquo;How are you ever to manage
continuing the payment of those enormous pensions of
yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not, I think, difficult to explain why Stubbs and
Gardiner are more precious possessions for students than
Lecky. Gardiner devoted his life to the seventeenth century.
If we may reckon the previous preparation and the
ceaseless revision, Stubbs devoted a good part of his life to
the constitutional history from the beginnings of it to Henry
VII. Lecky&#8217;s eight volumes on the eighteenth century
were published in thirteen years. A mastery of such an
amount of original material as Stubbs and Gardiner mastered
was impossible within that time. Lecky had the
<a name="png.166" id="png.166"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">158</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>faculty of historic divination which compensated to some
extent for the lack of a more thorough study of the sources.
Genius stood in the place of painstaking engrossment in a
single task.</p>

<p>The last important work of Lecky, &ldquo;Democracy and
Liberty,&rdquo; was a brave undertaking. Many years ago he
wrote: &ldquo;When I was deeply immersed in the &lsquo;History of
England in the Eighteenth Century,&rsquo; I remember being
struck by the saying of an old and illustrious friend that he
could not understand the state of mind of a man who, when
so many questions of burning and absorbing interest were
rising around him, could devote the best years of his life to
the study of a vanished past.&rdquo; Hence the book which considered
present issues of practical politics and party controversies,
and a result that satisfied no party and hardly
any faction. It is an interesting question who chose the
better part,&mdash;he or Stubbs and Gardiner&mdash;they who devoted
themselves entirely to the past or he who made a
conscientious endeavor to bring to bear his study of history
upon the questions of the present.</p>

<h2><a name="png.169" id="png.169"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">161</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>SIR SPENCER WALPOLE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Spencer Walpole</span> was an excellent historian and industrious
writer. His first important work, entitled &ldquo;The
History of England from 1815,&rdquo; was published at intervals
from 1878 to 1886; the first installment appeared when he
was thirty-nine years old. This in six volumes carried the
history to 1858 in an interesting, accurate, and impartial
narrative. Four of the five chapters of the first volume are
entitled &ldquo;The Material Condition of England in 1815,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Society in England,&rdquo; &ldquo;Opinion in 1815,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last of the
Ebb Tide,&rdquo; and they are masterly in their description and
relation. During the Napoleonic wars business was good.
The development of English manufactures, due largely to
the introduction of steam as a motive power, was marked.
&ldquo;Twenty years of war,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;had concentrated the
trade of the world in the British Empire.&rdquo; Wheat was
dear; in consequence the country gentlemen received high
rents. The clergy, being largely dependent on tithes,&mdash;the
tenth of the produce,&mdash;found their incomes increased
as the price of corn advanced. But the laboring classes,
both those engaged in manufactures and agriculture, did
not share in the general prosperity. Either their wages
did not rise at all or did not advance commensurately with
the increase of the cost of living and the decline in the value
of the currency. Walpole&#8217;s detailed and thorough treatment
of this subject is historic work of high value.</p>

<p>In the third volume I was much impressed with his account
of the Reform Act of 1832. We all have read that
wonderful story over and over again, but I doubt whether its
<a name="png.170" id="png.170"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">162</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>salient points have been better combined and presented
than in Walpole&#8217;s chapter. I had not remembered the
reason of the selection of Lord John Russell to present the
bill in the House of Commons when he was only Paymaster
of the Forces, without a seat in the Cabinet. It will, of
course, be recalled that Lord Grey, the Prime Minister, was
in the House of Lords, and, not so readily I think, that
Althorp was Chancellor of the Exchequer and the leader of
the House of Commons. On Althorp, under ordinary circumstances,
it would have been incumbent to take charge
of this highly important measure, which had been agreed
upon by the Cabinet after counsel with the King. Russell
was the youngest son of the Duke of Bedford; and the
Duke was one of the large territorial magnates and a proprietor
of rotten boroughs. &ldquo;A bill recommended by his
son&#8217;s authority,&rdquo; wrote Walpole, &ldquo;was likely to reassure
timid or wavering politicians.&rdquo; &ldquo;Russell,&rdquo; Walpole continued,
&ldquo;told his tale in the plainest language. But the
tale which he had to tell required no extraordinary language
to adorn it. The Radicals had not dared to expect, the
Tories, in their wildest fears, had not apprehended, so complete
a measure. Enthusiasm was visible on one side of
the House; consternation and dismay on the other. At
last, when Russell read the list of boroughs which were
doomed to extinction, the Tories hoped that the completeness
of the measure would insure its defeat. Forgetting
their fears, they began to be amused and burst into peals of
derisive laughter&rdquo; (III, 208).</p>

<p>Walpole&#8217;s next book was the &ldquo;Life of Lord John Russell,&rdquo;
two volumes published in 1889. This was undertaken at
the request of Lady Russell, who placed at his disposal a
mass of private and official papers and &ldquo;diaries and letters
of a much more private nature.&rdquo; She also acceded to his
<a name="png.171" id="png.171"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">163</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>request that she was not to see the biography until it was
ready for publication, so that the whole responsibility of it
would be Walpole&#8217;s alone. The Queen gave him access to
three bound volumes of Russell&#8217;s letters to herself, and sanctioned
the publication of certain letters of King William IV.
Walpole wrote the biography in about two years and a half;
and this, considering that at the time he held an active office,
displayed unusual industry. If I may judge the work by a
careful study of the chapter on &ldquo;The American Civil War,&rdquo;
it is a valuable contribution to political history.</p>

<p>Passing over three minor publications, we come to Walpole&#8217;s
&ldquo;History of Twenty-five Years,&rdquo; two volumes of
which were published in 1904. A brief extract from his
preface is noteworthy, written as it is by a man of keen intelligence,
with great power of investigation and continuous
labor, and possessed of a sound judgment. After a reference
to his &ldquo;History of England from 1815,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;The time
has consequently arrived when it ought to be as possible to
write the History of England from 1857 to 1880, as it was
twenty years ago to bring down the narrative of that History
to 1856 or 1857&hellip;. So far as I am able to judge, most of
the material which is likely to be available for British history
in the period with which these two volumes are concerned
[1856&ndash;1870] is already accessible. It is not probable that
much which is wholly new remains unavailable.&rdquo; I read
carefully these two volumes when they first appeared, and
found them exceedingly fascinating. Palmerston and Russell,
Gladstone and Disraeli, are made so real that we follow
their contests as if we ourselves had a hand in them. A half
dozen or more years ago an Englishman told me that Palmerston
and Russell were no longer considered of account in
England. But I do not believe one can rise from reading
these volumes without being glad of a knowledge of these
<a name="png.172" id="png.172"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">164</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>two men whose patriotism was of a high order. Walpole&#8217;s
several characterizations, in a summing up of Palmerston,
display his knowledge of men. &ldquo;Men pronounced Lord
Melbourne indifferent,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;Sir Robert Peel cold,
Lord John Russell uncertain, Lord Aberdeen weak, Lord
Derby haughty, Mr. Gladstone subtle, Lord Beaconsfield
unscrupulous. But they had no such epithet for Lord
Palmerston. He was as earnest as Lord Melbourne was
indifferent, as strong as Lord Aberdeen was weak, as honest
as Lord Beaconsfield was unscrupulous. Sir Robert Peel
repelled men by his temper; Lord John Russell, by his
coldness; Lord Derby offended them by his pride; Mr.
Gladstone distracted them by his subtlety. But Lord
Palmerston drew both friends and foes together by the
warmth of his manners and the excellence of his heart&rdquo;
(I, 525).</p>

<p>Walpole&#8217;s knowledge of continental politics was apparently
thorough. At all events, any one who desires two
entrancing tales, should read the chapter on &ldquo;The Union of
Italy,&rdquo; of which Cavour and Napoleon III are the heroes;
and the two chapters entitled &ldquo;The Growth of Prussia and
the Decline of France&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Fall of the Second Empire.&rdquo;
In these two chapters Napoleon III again appears,
but Bismarck is the hero. Walpole&#8217;s chapter on &ldquo;The
American Civil War&rdquo; is the writing of a broad-minded, intelligent
man, who could look on two sides.</p>

<p>Of Walpole&#8217;s last book, &ldquo;Studies in Biography,&rdquo; published
in 1907, I have left myself no time to speak. Those
who are interested in it should read the review of it in the
<cite>Nation</cite> early this year, which awards it high and unusual
commendation.</p>

<p>The readers of Walpole&#8217;s histories may easily detect in
them a treatment not possible from a mere closet student
<a name="png.173" id="png.173"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">165</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of books and manuscripts. A knowledge of the science of
government and of practical politics is there. For Walpole
was of a political family. He was of the same house as the
great Whig Prime Minister, Sir Robert; and his father was
Home Secretary in the Lord Derby ministry of 1858, and
again in 1866, when he had to deal with the famous Hyde
Park meeting of July 23. On his mother&#8217;s side he was a
grandson of Spencer Perceval, the Prime Minister who in
1812 was assassinated in the lobby of the House of Commons.
Walpole&#8217;s earliest publication was a biography of
Perceval.</p>

<p>And Spencer Walpole himself was a man of affairs. A clerk
in the War Office in 1858, private secretary to his father in
1866, next year Inspector of Fisheries, later Lieutenant-Governor
of the Isle of Man, and from 1893 to 1899 Secretary
to the Post-office. In spite of all this administrative
work his books show that he was a wide, general reader,
apart from his special historical studies. He wrote in an
agreeable literary style, with Macaulay undoubtedly as his
model, although he was by no means a slavish imitator.
His &ldquo;History of Twenty-five Years&rdquo; seems to me to be
written with a freer hand than the earlier history. He is
here animated by the spirit rather than the letter of Macaulay.
I no longer noticed certain tricks of expression which
one catches so easily in a study of the great historian, and
which seem so well to suit Macaulay&#8217;s own work, but nobody
else&#8217;s.</p>

<p>An article by Walpole on my first four volumes, in the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> of January, 1901, led to a correspondence
which resulted in my receiving an invitation last May
to pass Sunday with him at Hartfield Grove, his Sussex
country place. We were to meet at Victoria station and
take an early morning train. Seeing Mr. Frederic Harrison
<a name="png.174" id="png.174"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">166</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the day previous, I asked for a personal description of his
friend Walpole in order that I might easily recognize him.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says Harrison, &ldquo;perhaps I can guide you. A
while ago I sat next to a lady during a dinner who took me
for Walpole and never discovered her mistake until, when she
addressed me as Sir Spencer, I undeceived her just as the
ladies were retiring from the table. Now I am the elder by
eight years and I don&#8217;t think I look like Walpole, but that
good lady had another opinion.&rdquo; Walpole and Harrison
met that Saturday evening at the Academy dinner, and
Walpole obtained a personal description of myself. This
caution on both our parts was unnecessary. We were the
only historians traveling down on the train and could not
possibly have missed one another. I found him a thoroughly
genial man, and after fifteen minutes in the railway
carriage we were well acquainted. The preface to his
&ldquo;History of Twenty-five Years&rdquo; told that the two volumes
were the work of five years. I asked him how he was getting
on with the succeeding volumes. He replied that he had
done a good deal of work on them, and now that he was no
longer in an administrative position he could concentrate
his efforts, and he expected to have the work finished before
long. I inquired if the prominence of his family in politics
hampered him at all in writing so nearly contemporary
history, and he said, &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo; An hour of the railroad
and a half-hour&#8217;s drive brought us to his home. It was not
an ancestral place, but a purchase not many years back.
An old house had been remodeled with modern improvements,
and comfort and ease were the predominant aspects.
Sir Spencer proposed a &ldquo;turn&rdquo; before luncheon, which
meant a short walk, and after luncheon we had a real walk.
I am aware that the English mile and our own are alike
5280 feet, but I am always impressed with the fact that
<a name="png.175" id="png.175"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">167</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the English mile seems longer, and so I was on this Sunday.
For after a good two hours&#8217; exertion over hills and meadows
my host told me that we had gone only five miles. Only by
direct question did I elicit the fact that had he been alone he
would have done seven miles in the same time.</p>

<p>There were no other guests, and Lady Walpole, Sir Spencer,
and I had all of the conversation at luncheon and dinner
and during the evening. We talked about history and
literature, English and American politics, and public men.
He was singularly well informed about our country, although
he had only made one brief visit and then in an official capacity.
English expressions of friendship are now so common
that I will not quote even one of the many scattered through
his volumes, but he displayed everywhere a candid appreciation
of our good traits and creditable doings. I was struck
with his knowledge and love of lyric poetry. Byron, Shelley,
Keats, Tennyson, Longfellow, and Lowell were thoroughly
familiar to him. He would repeat some favorite
passage of Keats, and at once turn to a discussion of the
administrative details of his work in the post-office. Of
course the day and evening passed very quickly,&mdash;it was
one of the days to be marked with a white stone,&mdash;and
when I bade Walpole good-by on the Monday morning I
felt as if I were parting from a warm friend. I found him
broad-minded, intelligent, sympathetic, affable, and he
seemed as strong physically as he was sound intellectually.
His death on Sunday, July 7, of cerebral hemorrhage was
alike a shock and a grief.</p>

 /></span>JOHN RICHARD GREEN</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I wish</span> indeed that I had the tongues of men and of angels
to express the admiration of the reading public of America
for the History of John Richard Green. I suppose that he
has had more readers in our country than any other historian
except Macaulay, and he has shaped the opinions of men who
read, more than any writers of history except those whom
John Morley called the great born men of letters,&mdash;Gibbon,
Macaulay, and Carlyle.</p>

<p>I think it is the earlier volumes rather than the last volume
of his more extended work which have taken hold of us. Of
course we thrill at his tribute to Washington, where he has
summed up our reverence, trust, and faith in him in one
single sentence which shows true appreciation and deep
feeling; and it flatters our national vanity, of which we
have a goodly stock, to read in his fourth volume that the
creation of the United States was one of the turning points
in the history of the world.</p>

<p>No saying is more trite, at any rate to an educated American
audience, than that the development of the English
nation is one of the most wonderful things, if not the most
wonderful thing, which history records. That history before
James I is our own, and, to our general readers, it has
never been so well presented as in Green&#8217;s first two volumes.
The victories of war are our own. It was our ancestors
who preserved liberty, maintained order, set the train moving
toward religious toleration, and wrought out that language
and literature which we are proud of, as well
as you.</p>

<p><a name="png.180" id="png.180"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">172</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>For my own part, I should not have liked to miss reading
and re-reading the five chapters on Elizabeth in the second
volume. What eloquence in simply the title of the last,&mdash;The
England of Shakespeare! And in fact my conception
of Elizabeth, derived from Shakespeare, is confirmed by
Green. As I think how much was at stake in the last half
of the sixteenth century, and how well the troubles were met
by that great monarch and the wise statesman whom she
called to her aid, I feel that we could not be what we are,
had a weak, irresolute sovereign been at the head of the
state.</p>

<p>With the power of a master Green manifests what was
accomplished. At the accession of Elizabeth&mdash;&ldquo;Never&rdquo;
so he wrote&mdash;&ldquo;had the fortunes of England sunk to a
lower ebb. The loss of Calais gave France the mastery
of the Channel. The French King in fact &lsquo;bestrode the
realm, having one foot in Calais, and the other in <span class="rthinsp">Scotland.&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at the death of Elizabeth, thus Green tells the story:
&ldquo;The danger which had hitherto threatened our national
existence and our national unity had disappeared: France
clung to the friendship of England, Spain trembled beneath
its blows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the wide range of years of his subject, with a grasp
of an extended period akin to Gibbon&#8217;s, complete accuracy
was, of course, not attainable, but Samuel R. Gardiner once
told me that Green, although sometimes inaccurate in details,
gave a general impression that was justifiable and
correct; and that is in substance the published opinion of
Stubbs.</p>

<p>Goethe said that in reading Molière you perceive that he
possessed the charm of an amiable nature in habitual contact
with good society. So we, who had not the advantage of
<a name="png.181" id="png.181"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">173</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>personal intercourse, divined was the case of Green; and
when the volume of Letters appeared, we saw that we had
guessed correctly. But not until then did we know of his
devotion to his work, and his heroic struggle, which renders
the story of his short and brilliant career a touching and fascinating
biography of a historian who made his mark upon
his time.</p>

 class="pgmark">177</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>EDWARD L. PIERCE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I shall</span> first speak of Mr. Pierce as an author. His Life
of Sumner it seems to me is an excellent biography, and
the third and fourth volumes of it are an important contribution
to the history of our country. Any one who has
gone through the original material of the period he embraces
must be struck not only with the picture of Sumner, but
with the skill of the biographer in the use of his data to present
a general historical view. The injunction of Cicero,
&ldquo;Choose with discretion out of the plenty that lies before
you,&rdquo; Mr. Pierce observed. To those who know how extensive
was his reading of books, letters, newspaper files,
how much he had conversed with the actors in those stirring
scenes&mdash;and who will take into account the mass of memories
that crowd upon the mind of one who has lived through
such an era&mdash;this biography will seem not too long but
rather admirable in its relative brevity. In a talk that I had
with Mr. Pierce I referred to the notice in an English literary
weekly of his third and fourth volumes which maintained
that the biography was twice too long, and I took occasion
to say that in comparison with other American works of
the kind the criticism seemed unjust. &ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; I went
on, &ldquo;I think you showed restraint in not making use of much
of your valuable material,&mdash;of the interesting and even
important unprinted letters of Cobden, the Duke of Argyll,
and of John Bright.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Pierce, with a
twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;I can say with Lord Clive, &lsquo;Great
Heavens, at this moment I stand astonished at my own
<span class="rthinsp">moderation.&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.186" id="png.186"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">178</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Any one who has studied public sentiment in this country
for any period knows how easy it is to generalize from a few
facts, and yet, if the subject be more thoroughly investigated,
it becomes apparent how unsatisfactory such generalizations
are apt to be; not that they are essentially untrue,
but rather because they express only a part of the truth.
If a student should ask me in what one book he would find
the best statement of popular opinion at the North during
the Civil War, I should say, Read Sumner&#8217;s letters as cited
in Mr. Pierce&#8217;s biography with the author&#8217;s comments.
The speeches of Sumner may smell too much of the lamp
to be admirable, but the off-hand letters written to his English
and to a few American friends during our great struggle
are worthy of the highest esteem. From his conversations
with the President, the Cabinet ministers, his fellow-senators
and congressmen, his newspaper reading,&mdash;in short,
from the many impressions that go to make up the daily
life of an influential public man,&mdash;there has resulted an
accurate statement of the popular feeling from day to day.
In spite of his intense desire to have Englishmen of power
and position espouse the right side, he would not misrepresent
anything by the suppression of facts, any more than he
would make a misleading statement. In the selection of
these letters Mr. Pierce has shown a nice discrimination.</p>

<p>Sumner, whom I take to have been one of the most truthful
of men, was fortunate in having one of the most honest
of biographers. Mr. Pierce would not, I think, have wittingly
suppressed anything that told against him. I love
to think of one citation which would never have been made
by an idolizing biographer, so sharply did it bring out the
folly of the opinion expressed. Sumner wrote, May 3, 1863:
&ldquo;There is no doubt here about Hooker. He told Judge
Bates &hellip; that he &lsquo;did not mean to drive the enemy but
<a name="png.187" id="png.187"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">179</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to bag him.&rsquo; It is thought he is now doing it.&rdquo; The biographer&#8217;s
comment is brief, &ldquo;The letter was written on the
day of Hooker&#8217;s defeat at Chancellorsville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems to me that Mr. Pierce was as impartial in his
writing as is possible for a man who has taken an active part
in political affairs, who is thoroughly in earnest, and who has
a positive manner of expression. It is not so difficult as
some imagine for a student of history whose work is done in
the library to be impartial, provided he has inherited or acquired
the desire to be fair and honest, and provided he has
the diligence and patience to go through the mass of evidence.
His historical material will show him that to every
question there are two sides. But what of the man who has
been in the heat of the conflict, and who, when the fight was
on, believed with Sumner that there was no other side?
If such a man displays candor, how much greater his merit
than the impartiality of the scholar who shuns political
activity and has given himself up to a life of speculation!</p>

<p>I had the good fortune to have three long conversations
with the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, the last of which occurred
shortly after the publication of the third and fourth volumes
of the Life of Sumner. &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said Mr. Winthrop
to me, &ldquo;do you think of the chapter on the Annexation of
Texas and the Mexican War?&rdquo; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; was my reply,
&ldquo;that Mr. Pierce has treated a delicate subject like a gentleman.&rdquo;
&ldquo;From what I have heard of it,&rdquo; responded Mr.
Winthrop, earnestly, &ldquo;and from so much as I have read of it,
that is also my own opinion.&rdquo; Such a private conversation
I could, of course, repeat, and, somewhat later the occasion
presenting itself, I did so to Mr. Pierce. &ldquo;That is more
grateful to me,&rdquo; he said, almost with tears in his eyes, &ldquo;than
all the praise I have received for these volumes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce had, I think, the historic sense. I consulted
<a name="png.188" id="png.188"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">180</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>him several times on the treatment of historical matters,
taking care not to trench on questions where, so different
was our point of view, we could not possibly agree, and I
always received from him advice that was suggestive, even
if I did not always follow it to the letter. I sent to him,
while he was in London, my account of Secretary Cameron&#8217;s
report proposing to arm the slaves and of his removal from
office by President Lincoln. Mr. Pierce thought my inferences
were far-fetched, and wrote: &ldquo;I prefer the natural
explanation. Horace says we must not introduce a god
into a play unless it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a friend, he was warm-hearted and true. He brought
cheer and animation into your house. His talk was fresh;
his zeal for whatever was uppermost in his mind was contagious,
and he inspired you with enthusiasm. He was not
good at conversation, in the French sense of the term, for
he was given to monologue; but he was never dull. His
artlessness was charming. He gave you confidences that
you would have shrunk from hearing out of the mouth of any
other man, in the fear that you intruded on a privacy where
you had no right; but this openness of mind was so natural
in Mr. Pierce that you listened with concern and sympathized
warmly. He took interest in everything; he had infinite
resources, and until his health began to fail, enjoyed
life thoroughly. He loved society, conversation, travel;
and while he had no passion for books, he listened to you
attentively while you gave an abstract or criticism of some
book that was attracting attention. In all intercourse with
him you felt that you were in a healthy moral atmosphere.
I never knew a man who went out of his way oftener to do
good works in which there was absolutely no reward, and
at a great sacrifice of his time&mdash;to him a most precious
commodity. He was in the true sense of the word a
<a name="png.189" id="png.189"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">181</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>philanthropist, and yet no one would have approved more heartily
than he this remark of Emerson: &ldquo;The professed philanthropists
are an altogether odious set of people, whom one
would shun as the worst of bores and canters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His interest in this Society the published Proceedings will
show in some measure, but they cannot reflect the tone of
devotion in which he spoke of it in conversation, or exhibit
his loyalty to it as set forth in the personal letter. It was
a real privation that his legislative duties prevented his
attending these meetings last winter.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Pierce as a citizen most of you, gentlemen, can
speak better than I, but it does appear to me an instance of
rare civic virtue that a man of his age, political experience,
ability, and mental resources could take pride and pleasure
in his service in the House of Representatives of his Commonwealth.
He was sixty-eight years old, suffering from
disease, yet in his service last winter he did not miss one
legislative session nor a day meeting of his committee. His
love for his town was a mark of local attachment both
praiseworthy and useful. &ldquo;I would rather be moderator
of the Milton town-meeting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than hold any other
office in the United States.&rdquo;</p>

October meeting of 1900.</p>

<h2><a name="png.193" id="png.193"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">185</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>JACOB D. COX</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A useful</span> member of the legislature of his state, a general
in the army during the Civil War, governor of his state,
Secretary of the Interior in President Grant&#8217;s Cabinet, a
member of Congress, the president of a large railroad,
a writer of books, dean and teacher in a law school, and a
reviewer of books in the <cite>Nation</cite>,&mdash;such were the varied
activities of General Cox. All this work was done with
credit. He bore a prominent part in the battle of Antietam,
where Ropes speaks of his &ldquo;brilliant success&rdquo;; he was the
second in command at the battle of Franklin, and bore the
brunt of the battle. &ldquo;Brigadier-General J.&nbsp;D. Cox,&rdquo; wrote
Schofield, the commanding general, in his report, &ldquo;deserves
a very large share of credit for the brilliant victory at
Franklin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The governor of the state of Ohio did not then have a
great opportunity of impressing himself upon the minds of
the people of his state, but Cox made his mark in the canvass
for that office. We must call to mind that in the year 1865,
when he was the Republican candidate for governor, President
Johnson had initiated his policy of reconstruction, but
had not yet made a formal break with his party. Negro
suffrage, which only a few had favored during the last year
of the war, was now advocated by the radical Republicans,
and the popular sentiment of the party was tending in that
direction. Cox had been a strong antislavery man before
the war, a supporter of President Lincoln in his emancipation
measures, but soon after his nomination for governor he
wrote a letter to his radical friends at Oberlin in opposition
<a name="png.194" id="png.194"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">186</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to negro suffrage. &ldquo;You assume,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the extension
of the right of suffrage to the blacks, leaving them
intermixed with the whites, will cure all the trouble. I
believe it would rather be like the decision in that outer
darkness of which Milton speaks where</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i8">&ldquo;<span class="lthinsp">&lsquo;chaos</span> umpire sits,</div>
<div>And by decision more embroils the <span class="rthinsp">fray.&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</div>
</div>

<p>While governor, he said in a private conversation that he
had come to the conclusion &ldquo;that so large bodies of black
men and white as were in presence in the Southern States
never could share political power, and that the insistence
upon it on the part of the colored people would lead to their
ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>President Grant appointed General Cox Secretary of the
Interior, and he remained for nearly two years in the
Cabinet. James Russell Lowell, on a visit to Washington
in 1870, gave expression to the feeling among independent
Republicans. &ldquo;Judge Hoar,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and Mr. Cox
struck me as the only really strong men in the Cabinet.&rdquo;
This was long before the Civil Service Reform Act had passed
Congress, but Secretary Cox put the Interior Department
on a merit basis, and he was ever afterwards an advocate of
civil service reform by word of mouth and with his pen.
Differences with the President, in which I feel pretty sure
that the Secretary was in the right, caused him to resign
the office.</p>

<p>Elected to Congress in 1876, he was a useful member for
one term. He has always been known to men in public life,
and when President McKinley offered him the position of
Minister to Spain something over three years ago, it was felt
that a well-known and capable man had been selected. For
various reasons he did not accept the appointment, but if he
<a name="png.195" id="png.195"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">187</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>had done so, no one could doubt that he would have shown
tact and judgment in the difficult position.</p>

<p>As president of the Wabash Railroad, one of the large
railroads in the West, he gained a name among business
men, and five or six years ago was offered the place of Railroad
Commissioner in New York City. This was practically
the position of arbitrator between the trunk lines, but he
was then Dean of the Cincinnati Law School and interested
in a work which he did not care to relinquish.</p>

<p>Besides a controversial monograph, he wrote three books
on military campaigns: &ldquo;Atlanta&rdquo;; &ldquo;The March to the
Sea; Franklin and Nashville&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Battle of Franklin&rdquo;;
and he wrote four excellent chapters for Force&#8217;s &ldquo;Life of
General Sherman.&rdquo; In these he showed qualities of a military
historian of a high order. Before his death he had
finished his Reminiscences, which will be brought out by
the Scribners this autumn.</p>

<p>His differences with President Grant while in his Cabinet
left a wound, and in private conversation he was quite severe
in his strictures of many of the President&#8217;s acts, but he never
let this feeling influence him in the slightest degree in the
consideration of Grant the General. He had a very high
idea of Grant&#8217;s military talents, which he has in many ways
emphatically stated.</p>

<p>Since 1874 he had been a constant contributor to the
literary department of the <cite>Nation</cite>. In his book reviews
he showed a fine critical faculty and large general information,
and some of his obituary notices&mdash;especially those of
Generals Buell, Grant, Sherman, Joseph E. Johnston, and
Jefferson Davis&mdash;showed that power of impartial characterization
which is so great a merit in a historian. He was
an omnivorous reader of serious books. It was difficult to
name any noteworthy work of history or biography or any
<a name="png.196" id="png.196"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">188</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>popular book on natural science with which he was not
acquainted.</p>

<p>As I saw him two years ago, when he was seventy years
old, he was in the best of health and vigor, which seemed to
promise many years of life. He was tall, erect, with a frame
denoting great physical strength, and he had distinctively
a military bearing. He was an agreeable companion, an excellent
talker, a scrupulously honest and truthful man, and
a gentleman.</p>

 /></span>EDWARD GAYLORD BOURNE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> an associate dies who was not yet forty-eight years
old, whom most of us knew as a strong enduring man, who
was capable of an immense amount of intellectual work, it
is a real calamity,&mdash;a calamity which in this case History
mourns, as Edward Gaylord Bourne was an excellent teacher
and a thorough historical scholar. The physical details of
any illness are apt to be repulsive, but the malady in Bourne&#8217;s
case was somehow so bound up in his life that an inquiry
into it comes from no morbid curiosity. When ten years
old he was attacked with tubercular disease of the hip, and
for some weeks his life was despaired of; but he was saved
by the loving care of his parents, receiving particular devotion
from his father, who was a Congregational minister in
charge of a parish in Connecticut. As the left leg had out-grown
the other, Bourne was obliged to use crutches for
three years, when his father took him to a specialist in Boston,
and the result was that he was able to abandon crutches
and in the end to get about by an appliance to adjust the
lengths of the different legs, such as his friends were familiar
with. Despite this disability he developed great physical
strength, especially in the chest and arms, but his lameness
prevented his accompanying his college companions on
long tramps, so that the bicycle was for him a most welcome
invention. He became expert in the use of it, riding on it
down Pike&#8217;s Peak at the time of his visit to Colorado; and
he performed a similar feat of endurance on another occasion
when stopping with me at Jefferson in the White Mountains.
Starting early in the morning, he traveled by rail to the
<a name="png.200" id="png.200"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">192</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>terminus of the mountain railroad, went up Mount Washington
on the railroad, and rode down the carriage road on his
wheel to the Glen House, which ought to have been enough
of fatigue and exertion for one day, but he then had about
ten miles to make on his bicycle over a somewhat rough
mountain road to reach Jefferson. Jefferson he did make,
but not until after midnight.</p>

<p>During an acquaintance of over nineteen years with
Bourne, I was always impressed with his physical strength
and endurance; and I was therefore much surprised to
learn, in a letter received from him last winter while I was
in Rome, that his youthful malady had attacked him, that
he was again on crutches and had been obliged to give up
his work at Yale. In truth ever since the autumn of 1906
he has had a painful, hopeless struggle. He has had the
benefit of all the resources of medicine and surgery, and he
and his wife were buoyed up by hope until the last; but as
the sequel of one of a series of operations death came to his
relief on February 24.</p>

<p>Only less remarkable than his struggle for life and physical
strength was his energy in acquiring an education. The
sacrifices that parents in New England and the rest of the
country make in order to send their boys to school and college
is a common enough circumstance, but not always is the
return so satisfactory as it was in the case of Edward Bourne,
and his brother. Edward went to the Norwich Academy,
where his studious disposition and diligent purpose gained
him the favor of the principal. Thence to Yale, where he
attracted the attention of Professor William G. Sumner,
who became to him a guide and a friend. Until his senior
year at Yale his favorite studies were Latin and Greek; and
his brother, who was in his class, informs me that ever since
his preparatory school days, it was his custom to read the
<a name="png.201" id="png.201"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">193</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>whole of any author in hand as well as the part set for the
class. During recitations he recalls seeing him again and
again reading ahead in additional books of the author, keeping
at the same time &ldquo;a finger on the page where the class
was translating, in order not to be caught off his guard.&rdquo;
In his senior year at Yale, under the influence of Professor
Sumner, he became interested in economics and won the
Cobden medal. After graduation he wrote his first historical
book, &ldquo;The History of the Surplus Revenue of 1837,&rdquo;
published in 1885 in Putnam&#8217;s &ldquo;Questions of the Day&rdquo;
series. For this and his other graduate work his university
later conferred upon him the degree of Ph.D. Since I
have learned the story of his boyhood and youth, it is with
peculiar appreciation that I read the dedication of this first
book: &ldquo;To my Father and Mother.&rdquo; I may add in this
connection that while pursuing his indefatigable labors for
the support of his large family, his father&#8217;s sickness and
death overtaxed his strength, and the breakdown followed.</p>

<p>At Yale during his graduate work he won the Foote
scholarship; he was instructor in history there from 1886
to 1888, then took a similar position at Adelbert College,
Cleveland, becoming Professor of History in 1890. This
post he held until 1895, when he was called to Yale University
as Professor of History, a position that he held at
the time of his death.</p>

<p>Besides the doctor&#8217;s thesis, Bourne published two books,
the first of which was &ldquo;Essays in Historical Criticism,&rdquo; one
of the Yale bicentennial publications, the most notable
essay in which is that on Marcus Whitman. A paper read
at the Ann Arbor session of the American Historical meeting
in Detroit and later published in the <cite>American Historical
Review</cite> is here amplified into a long and exhaustive treatment
of the subject. The original paper gained Bourne
<a name="png.202" id="png.202"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">194</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>some celebrity and subjected him to some harsh criticism,
both of which, I think, he thoroughly enjoyed. Feeling
sure of his facts and ground, he delighted in his final word
to support the contention which he had read with emphasis
and pleasure to an attentive audience in one of the halls of
the University of Michigan. The final paragraph sums up
what he set out to prove with undoubted success:</p>

<p class="blockquote">
That Marcus Whitman was a devoted and heroic missionary
who braved every hardship and imperilled his life for the cause of
Christian missions and Christian civilization in the far Northwest
and finally died at his post, a sacrifice to the cause, will not be
gainsaid. That he deserves grateful commemoration in Oregon
and Washington is beyond dispute. But that he is a national
figure in American history, or that he &ldquo;saved&rdquo; Oregon, must be
rejected as a fiction [p.&nbsp;100].
</p>

<p>Bourne had a good knowledge of American history, and
he specialized on the Discoveries period, to which he gave
close and continuous attention. He was indebted to Professor
Hart&#8217;s ambitious and excellent coöperative history,
&ldquo;The American Nation,&rdquo; for the opportunity to obtain a
hearing on his favorite subject. His &ldquo;Spain in America,&rdquo;
his third published book, is the book of a scholar. While
the conditions of his narrative allowed only forty-six pages
to the story of Columbus, he had undoubtedly material
enough well arranged and digested to fill the volume on this
topic alone. I desire to quote a signal example of compression:</p>

<p class="blockquote">
It was November, 1504, when Columbus arrived in Seville, a
broken man, something over twelve years from the time he first
set sail from Palos. Each successive voyage since his first had
left him at a lower point. On his return from the second he was
on the defensive; after his third he was deprived of his viceroyalty;
on his fourth he was shipwrecked&hellip;. The last blow, the death
of his patron Isabella, soon followed. It was months before he was
<a name="png.203" id="png.203"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">195</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>able to attend court. His strength gradually failed, he sank
from public view, and on the eve of Ascension Day, May 20, 1506,
he passed away in obscurity [p.&nbsp;81].
</p>

<p>And I am very fond of this final characterization:</p>

<p class="blockquote">
Columbus &hellip; has revealed himself in his writings as few men
of action have been revealed. His hopes, his illusions, his vanity,
and love of money, his devotion to by-gone ideals, his keen and
sensitive observation of the natural world, his credulity and utter
lack of critical power in dealing with literary evidence, his practical
abilities as a navigator, his tenacity of purpose and boldness of
execution, his lack of fidelity as a husband and a lover,&hellip; all
stand out in clear relief&hellip;. Of all the self-made men that
America has produced, none has had a more dazzling success, a
more pathetic sinking to obscurity, or achieved a more universal
celebrity [p.&nbsp;82].

<p>His chapter on Magellan is thoroughly interesting. The
treatment of Columbus and Magellan shows what Bourne
might have achieved in historical work if he could have had
leisure to select his own subjects and elaborate them at will.</p>

<p>Before &ldquo;Spain in America&rdquo; appeared, he wrote a scholarly
introduction to the vast work on the &ldquo;Philippine Islands&rdquo;
published by the Arthur H. Clark Company, of Cleveland,
of which fifty-one volumes are already out. The study of
this subject gave Bourne a chance for the exhibition of his
dry wit at one of the gatherings of the American Historical
Association. It was asserted that in the acquisition of the
Philippine Islands our country had violated the spirit of
the Monroe Doctrine, which properly confined our indulgence
of the land hunger that is preying upon the world to the Western
hemisphere. Bourne took issue with this statement. He
said that it might well be a question whether the Philippine
Islands did not belong to the Western hemisphere and that--</p>

<p class="blockquote noindent">
for the first three centuries of their recorded history, they were in
a sense a dependency of America. As a dependency of New Spain
<a name="png.204" id="png.204"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>they constituted the extreme western verge of the Spanish dominions
and were commonly known as the Western Islands.
When the sun rose in Madrid it was still early afternoon of the
preceding day in Manila. Down to the end of the year 1844 the
Manilan calendar was reckoned after that of Spain, that is, Manila
time was about sixteen hours slower than Madrid time.

<p>Bourne undertook to write the Life of Motley for
Houghton, Mifflin and Company&#8217;s American Men of Letters
series, and he had done considerable work in the investigation
of material. He was editor of a number of publications,
one of which was John Fiske&#8217;s posthumous volume, &ldquo;New
France and New England,&rdquo; and he wrote critical notices
for the <cite>Nation</cite>, <cite>New York Tribune</cite>, and the <cite>New York
Times</cite>. As I have said, he had a large family to support,
and he sought work of the potboiling order; but in this
necessary labor he never sacrificed his ideal of thoroughness.
A remark that he made to me some while ago has
come back with pathetic interest. After telling me what he
was doing, how much time his teaching left for outside work,
why he did this and that because it brought him money, he
said: &ldquo;I can get along all right. I can support my family,
educate my children, and get a little needed recreation, if
only my health does not break down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bourne took great interest in the American Historical
Association, and rarely if ever missed an annual meeting.
He frequently read papers, which were carefully prepared,
and a number of them are printed in the volume of Essays
to which I have referred. He was the efficient chairman of
the programme committee at the meeting in New Haven in
1898; and as chairman of an important committee, or as
member of the Council, he attended the November dinners
and meetings in New York, so that he came to be looked
upon as one of the chief supporters of the Association.
<a name="png.205" id="png.205"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">197</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Interested also in the <cite>American Historical Review</cite>, he was
a frequent contributor of critical book notices.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with Bourne began in 1888, the year in
which I commenced the composition of my history. We
were both living in Cleveland, and, as it was his custom to
dine with me once or twice a month, acquaintance grew into
friendship, and I came to have a great respect for his training
and knowledge as a historical scholar. The vastness of historical
inquiry impressed me, as it has all writers of history.
Recognizing in Bourne a kindred spirit, it occurred to me
whether I could not hasten my work if he would employ
part of his summer vacation in collecting material. I imparted
the idea to Bourne, who received it favorably, and
he spent a month of the summer of 1889 at work for me in
the Boston Athenæum on my general specifications, laboring
with industry and discrimination over the newspapers of
the early &#8217;50&#8217;s to which we had agreed to confine his work.
His task completed, he made me a visit of a few days at
Bar Harbor, affording an opportunity for us to discuss the
period and his material. I was so impressed with the value
of his assistance that, when the manuscript of my first two
volumes was completed in 1891, I asked him to spend a
month with me and work jointly on its revision. We used
to devote four or five hours a day to this labor, and in 1894,
when I had finished my third volume, we had a similar collaboration.<sup><a href="#fn.xiii.1"
 name="fna.xiii.1" id="fna.xiii.1">1</a></sup>
I have never known a better test of general
knowledge and intellectual temper.</p>

<p>Bourne was a slow thinker and worker, but he was sure,
and, when he knew a thing, his exposition was clear and
pointed. The chance of reflection over night and the
<a name="png.206" id="png.206"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">198</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>occasional discussion at meal times, outside of our set hours,
gave him the opportunity to recall all his knowledge bearing
on the subject in hand, to digest and classify it thoroughly,
so that, when he tackled a question, he talked, so to speak,
like a book. Two chapters especially attracted him,&mdash;the
one on Slavery in my first volume, and the one on general
financial and social conditions at the beginning of the third;
and I think that I may say that not only every paragraph
and sentence, but every important word in these two chapters
was discussed and weighed. Bourne was a good critic,
and, to set him entirely at ease, as he was twelve years
younger, I told him to lay aside any respect on account of
age, and to speak out frankly, no matter how hard it hit,
adding that I had better hear disagreeable things from him
than to have them said by critics after the volumes were
printed.</p>

<p>The intelligent note on page 51 of my third volume was
written by Bourne, as I state in the note itself, but I did not
speak of the large amount of study he gave to it. I never
knew a man take keener interest in anything, and as we had
all the necessary authorities at hand, he worked over them
for two days, coming down on the morning of the third day
with the triumphant air of one who had wrestled successfully
with a mathematical problem all night. He sat down and,
as I remember it, wrote the note substantially as it now
stands in the volume. He was very strong on all economic
and sociological questions, displaying in a marked degree
the intellectual stimulus he had derived from his association
with Professor Sumner. He was a born controversialist
and liked to argue. &ldquo;The appetite comes in eating&rdquo; is a
French saying, and with Bourne his knowledge seemed to be
best evolved by the actual joint working and collision with
another mind.</p>

<p><a name="png.207" id="png.207"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">199</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>I remember one felicitous suggestion of Bourne&#8217;s which
after much working over we incorporated into a paragraph
to our common satisfaction; and this paragraph received
commendation in some critical notice. Showing this to
Bourne, I said: &ldquo;That is the way of the world. You did
the thinking, I got the credit.&rdquo; Bourne had, however, forgotten
his part in the paragraph. His mind was really so
full of knowledge, when one could get at it, that he did not
remember giving off any part of it. In addition to his
quality of close concentration, he acquired a good deal of
knowledge in a desultory way. In my library when conversation
lagged he would go to the shelves and take down
book after book, reading a little here or there, lighting especially
upon any books that had been acquired since his
previous visit, and with reading he would comment. This
love of browsing in a library he acquired when a boy, so
his brother informs me, and when at Yale it was said that he
knew the library as well as the librarian himself.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that last spring our accomplished
editor, Mr. Smith, decided that he could no longer bear the
burden of this highly important work; and the question of
a fit successor came up at once in the mind of our President.
Writing to me while I was in Europe, he expressed the desire
of consulting with me on the subject as soon as I returned.
I was unfortunately unable to get back in time for the June
meeting of the Society; and afterwards when I reached
Boston the President had gone West, and when he got home
I was at Seal Harbor. To spare me the trip to Boston and
Lincoln, he courteously offered to come to see me at Seal
Harbor, where we had the opportunity to discuss the subject
in all its bearings. It will be quite evident from this
narrative that my choice for editor would be no other than
Professor Bourne, and I was much gratified to learn that
<a name="png.208" id="png.208"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">200</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the President from his own observation and reflection had
determined on the same man. Mr. Adams had been accustomed
to see Bourne at meetings of the American Historical
Association and at dinners of their Council; but, so
he informed me, he was not specially impressed by him until
he read the essay on Marcus Whitman, which gave him
a high idea of Bourne&#8217;s power of working over material, and
his faculty of trenchant criticism. We arrived readily at
the conclusion that Bourne would be an ideal editor and
that the position would suit him perfectly. Relieved of
the drudgery of teaching, he could give full swing to his love
of books and to his desire of running down through all the
authorities some fact or reference bearing upon the subject
in hand. The work would be a labor of love on which he
could bring to bear his knowledge, conscientious endeavor,
and historical training. It would have been a case of mutual
benefit. He would be fortunate in securing such a
position, and the Society might be congratulated on being
able to get a man so peculiarly qualified for editorial work.
But there was the question of Bourne&#8217;s health. We both
knew that he had been failing, but we were not aware that
his case was hopeless. The President did not wish to present
his recommendation to the Council until there was a
reasonable chance of his recovery, and I undertook from
time to time to get information from a common friend in
New Haven of his progress. But there was no good news.
While Bourne, with the help of his devoted wife, made an
energetic fight for life, it was unavailing. In his death Yale
lost an excellent teacher of history and this Society a candidate
who, if he had been chosen, would have made an
accomplished editor.</p>

<p class="i"><a name="fn.xiii.1" id="fn.xiii.1" href="#fna.xiii.1">1</a>
Bourne also revised the manuscript of my fourth volume, but the conditions
did not admit of our being together more than two days, and the revision
was not so satisfactory to either of us as that of the first three volumes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> English Constitution, as it existed between 1760 and
1787, was the model of the American, but parts of it were
inapplicable to the conditions in which the thirteen Colonies
found themselves, and where the model failed the Convention
struck out anew. The sagacity of the American statesmen
in this creative work may well fill Englishmen, so Sir
Henry Maine wrote, &ldquo;with wonder and envy.&rdquo; Mr. Bryce&#8217;s
classification of constitutions as flexible and rigid is apt:
of our Constitution it may be said that in the main it is
rigid in those matters which should not be submitted to the
decision of a legislature or to a popular vote without checks
which secure reflection and a chance for the sober second
thought, and that it has proved flexible in its adaptation to
the growth of the country and to the development of the
nineteenth century. Sometimes, though, it is flexible to
the extent of lacking precision. An instance of this is the
proviso for the counting of the electoral vote. &ldquo;The votes
shall then be counted&rdquo; are the words. Thus, when in 1876
it was doubtful whether Tilden or Hayes had been chosen
President, a fierce controversy arose as to who should count
the votes, the President of the Senate or Congress. While
many regretted the absence of an incontrovertible provision,
it was fortunate for the country that the Constitution did not
provide that the vote should be counted by the President of
the Senate, who, the Vice President having died in office,
was in 1877 a creature of the partisan majority. It is doubtful,
too, if the decision of such an officer would have been
acquiesced in by the mass of Democrats, who thought that
<a name="png.212" id="png.212"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">204</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>they had fairly elected their candidate. There being no
express declaration of the Constitution, it devolved upon
Congress to settle the dispute; the ability and patriotism
of that body was equal to the crisis. By a well-devised
plan of arbitration, Congress relieved the strain and provided
for a peaceful settlement of a difficulty which in most
countries would have led to civil war.</p>

<p>In the provisions conferring the powers and defining the
duties of the executive the flexible character of the Constitution
is shown in another way. Everything is clearly
stated, but the statements go not beyond the elementary.
The Convention knew what it wanted to say, and Gouverneur
Morris, who in the end drew up the document, wrote
this part of it, as indeed all other parts, in clear and effective
words. It is due to him, wrote Laboulaye, that the Constitution
has a &ldquo;distinctness entirely French, in happy contrast
to the complicated language of the English laws.&rdquo;
Yet on account of the elementary character of the article
of the Constitution on the powers of the President, there is
room for inference, a chance for development, and an opportunity
for a strong man to imprint his character upon the
office. The Convention, writes Mr. Bryce, made its executive
a George III &ldquo;shorn of a part of his prerogative,&rdquo;
his influence and dignity diminished by a reduction of the
term of office to four years. The English writer was thoroughly
familiar with the <cite>Federalist</cite>, and appreciated Hamilton&#8217;s
politic efforts to demonstrate that the executive of
the Constitution was modeled after the governors of the
states, and not after the British monarch; but &ldquo;an enlarged
copy of the state governor,&rdquo; Mr. Bryce asserts, is one and
the same thing as &ldquo;a reduced and improved copy of the
English king.&rdquo; But, on the other hand, Bagehot did not
believe that the Americans comprehended the English
<a name="png.213" id="png.213"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">205</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Constitution. &ldquo;Living across the Atlantic,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and
misled by accepted doctrines, the acute framers of the Federal
Constitution, even after the keenest attention, did not
perceive the Prime Minister to be the principal executive
of the British Constitution, and the sovereign a cog in the
mechanism;&rdquo; and he seems to think that if this had been
understood the executive power would have been differently
constituted.</p>

<p>It is a pertinent suggestion of Mr. Bryce&#8217;s that the members
of the Convention must have been thinking of their
presiding officer, George Washington, as the first man who
would exercise the powers of the executive office they were
creating. So it turned out. Never did a country begin a
new enterprise with so wise a ruler. An admirable polity
had been adopted, but much depended upon getting it to
work, and the man who was selected to start the government
was the man of all men for the task. Histories many and
from different points of view have been written of Washington&#8217;s
administration; all are interesting, and the subject
seems to ennoble the writers. Statesmen meeting with
students to discuss the character and political acts of Washington
marvel at his wisdom in great things and his patience
in small things, at the dignity and good sense with which
he established the etiquette of his office, at the tact which
retained in his service two such irreconcilable men as Jefferson
and Hamilton. The importance of a good start for an
infant government is well understood. But for our little
state of four million people such a start was difficult to secure.
The contentions which grew out of the ratification
of the Constitution in the different states had left bitter
feelings behind them, and these domestic troubles were
heightened by our intimate relations with foreign countries.
We touched England, France, and Spain at delicate points,
<a name="png.214" id="png.214"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">206</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and the infancy of our nation was passed during the turmoil
of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror.
In our midst there was an English and a French party.
Moreover, in the judgment of the world the experiment of
the new government was foredoomed to failure. Wrote
Sir Henry Maine, &ldquo;It is not at all easy to bring home to
the men of the present day how low the credit of republics
had sunk before the establishment of the United States.&rdquo;
Hardly were success to be won had we fallen upon quiet
times; but with free governments discredited, and the
word &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; made a reproach by the course of the French
Revolution, it would seem impossible.</p>

<p>Washington&#8217;s prescience is remarkable. Recognizing,
in October, 1789, that France had &ldquo;gone triumphantly
through the first paroxysm,&rdquo; he felt that she must encounter
others, that more blood must be shed, that she might
run from one extreme to another, and that &ldquo;a higher-toned
despotism&rdquo; might replace &ldquo;the one which existed before.&rdquo;
Mentally prepared as he was, he met with skill the difficulties
as they arose, so that the conduct of our foreign relations
during the eight years of his administration was marked
by discretion and furnished a good pattern to follow. During
his foreign negotiations he determined a constitutional
question of importance. When the Senate had ratified and
Washington, after some delay, had signed the Jay treaty,
the House of Representatives, standing for the popular
clamor against it, asked the President for all the papers
relating to the negotiation, on the ground that the House
of Representatives must give its concurrence. This demand
he resisted, maintaining that it struck at &ldquo;the fundamental
principles of the Constitution,&rdquo; which conferred upon the
President and the Senate the power of making treaties, and
provided that these treaties when made and ratified were
<a name="png.215" id="png.215"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">207</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the supreme law of the land. In domestic affairs he showed
discernment in selecting as his confidential adviser, Alexander
Hamilton, a man who had great constructive talent;
and he gave a demonstration of the physical strength of
the government by putting down the whisky rebellion in
Pennsylvania. During his eight years he construed the
powers conferred upon the executive by the Constitution
with wisdom, and exercised them with firmness and vigor.
Washington was a man of exquisite manners and his conduct
of the office gave it a dignity and prestige which, with
the exception of a part of one term, it has never lost.</p>

<p>Four of the five Presidents who followed Washington were
men of education and ability, and all of them had large
political training and experience; they reached their position
by the process of a natural selection in politics, being
entitled fitly to the places for which they were chosen. The
three first fell upon stormy times and did their work during
periods of intense partisan excitement; they were also
subject to personal detraction, but the result in the aggregate
of their administrations was good, inasmuch as they
either maintained the power of the executive or increased
its influence. Despite their many mistakes they somehow
overcame the great difficulties. Each one did something
of merit and the country made a distinct gain from John
Adams to Monroe. Any one of them suffers by comparison
with Washington: the &ldquo;era of good feeling&rdquo; was due to
Congress and the people as well as to the executive. Nevertheless,
the three turbulent administrations and the two
quiet ones which succeeded Washington&#8217;s may at this distance
from them be contemplated with a feeling of gratulation.
The Presidents surrounded themselves for the most
part with men of ability, experience, and refinement, who
carried on the government with dignity and a sense of
<a name="png.216" id="png.216"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">208</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>proportion, building well upon the foundations which Washington
had laid.</p>

<p>A contrast between France and the United States leads
to curious reflections. The one has a past rich in art, literature,
and architecture, which the other almost entirely
lacks. But politically the older country has broken with
the past, while we have political traditions peculiar to ourselves
of the highest value. For the man American-born
they may be summed up in Washington, the rest of the
&ldquo;Fathers,&rdquo; and the Constitution; and those who leave
England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Germany, and Scandinavia
to make their home in America soon come to share in
these possessions. While the immigrants from southern
Europe do not comprehend the Constitution, they know
Washington. An object lesson may be had almost any
pleasant Sunday or holiday in the public garden in Boston
from the group of Italians who gather about the statue of
Washington, showing, by their mobile faces and animated
talk, that they revere him who is the father of their adopted
country.</p>

<p>During these five administrations, at least two important
extensions or assertions of executive power were made. In
1803 Jefferson bought Louisiana, doing, he said, &ldquo;an act
beyond the Constitution.&rdquo; He was a strict constructionist,
and was deeply concerned at the variance between his constitutional
principles and a desire for the material advantage
of his country. In an effort to preserve his consistency
he suggested to his Cabinet and political friends an amendment
to the Constitution approving and confirming the
cession of this territory, but they, deeming such an amendment
entirely unnecessary, received his suggestion coldly.
In the debate on the Louisiana treaty in the Senate and the
House, all speakers of both parties agreed that &ldquo;the United
<a name="png.217" id="png.217"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">209</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>States government had the power to acquire new territory
either by conquest or by treaty.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.1"
 name="fna.xiv.1" id="fna.xiv.1">1</a></sup> Louisiana, &ldquo;without
its consent and against its will,&rdquo; was annexed to the United
States, and Jefferson &ldquo;made himself monarch of the new
territory, and wielded over it, against its protests, the powers
of its old kings.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.2"
 name="fna.xiv.2" id="fna.xiv.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The assertion by the President in 1823 of the Monroe
Doctrine (which Mr. Worthington C. Ford has shown to be
the John Quincy Adams doctrine) is an important circumstance
in the development of the executive power.</p>

<p>President John Quincy Adams was succeeded by Andrew
Jackson, a man of entirely different character from those
who had preceded him in the office, and he represented
different aims. Adams deserved another term. His sturdy
Americanism, tempered by the cautiousness in procedure
which was due to his rare training, made him an excellent
public servant, and the country erred in not availing itself
of his further service. The change from the <em>régime</em> of the
first six Presidents to that of Jackson was probably inevitable.
A high-toned democracy, based on a qualified suffrage,
believing in the value of training for public life and
administrative office, setting a value on refinement and good
manners, was in the end sure to give way to a pure democracy
based on universal suffrage whenever it could find
a leader to give it force and direction. Jackson was such a
leader. His followers felt: &ldquo;He is one of us. He is not
proud and does not care for style.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.3"
 name="fna.xiv.3" id="fna.xiv.3">3</a></sup> The era of vulgarity
in national politics was ushered in by Jackson, who as President
introduced the custom of rewarding political workers
with offices, an innovation entirely indefensible; he ought
to have continued the practice of his six predecessors. The
interaction between government and politics on the one hand
<a name="png.218" id="png.218"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">210</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and the life of the people on the other is persistent, and it
may be doubted whether the United States would have
seemed as it did to Dickens had not Jackson played such
an important part in the vulgarization of politics. Yet it
was a happy country, as the pages of Tocqueville bear
witness.</p>

<p>Jackson was a strong executive and placed in his Cabinet
men who would do his will, and who, from his own point
of view, were good advisers, since they counseled him to
pursue the course he had marked out for himself. Comparing
his Cabinet officers to those of the Presidents
preceding him, one realizes that another plan of governing
was set on foot, based on the theory that any American
citizen is fit for any position to which he is called. It was
an era when special training for administrative work
began to be slighted, when education beyond the rudiments
was considered unnecessary except in the three professions,
when the practical man was apotheosized and the bookish
man despised. Jackson, uneducated and with little experience
in civil life, showed what power might be exercised
by an arbitrary, unreasonable man who had the people
at his back. The brilliant three&mdash;Webster, Clay, and Calhoun&mdash;were
unable to prevail against his power.</p>

<p>Jackson&#8217;s financial policy may be defended; yet had it
not been for his course during the nullification trouble, his
declaration, &ldquo;Our Federal Union: It must be preserved,&rdquo;
and his consistent and vigorous action in accordance with
that sentiment it would be difficult to affirm that the influence
of his two terms of office was good. It cannot be
said that he increased permanently the power of the executive,
but he showed its capabilities. It is somewhat
curious, however, that Tocqueville, whose observations were
made under Jackson, should have written: &ldquo;The President
<a name="png.219" id="png.219"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">211</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>possesses almost royal prerogatives, which he never
has an opportunity of using&hellip;. The laws permit him
to be strong; circumstances keep him weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eight Presidents from Jackson to Lincoln did not
raise the character of the presidential office. Van Buren
was the heir of Jackson. Of the others, five owed their
nominations to their availability. The evil which Jackson
did lived after him; indeed, only a man as powerful for the
good as he had been for the bad could have restored the
civil service to the merit system which had prevailed before
he occupied the White House. The offices were at stake
in every election, and the scramble for them after the determination
of the result was great and pressing. The chief
business of a President for many months after his inauguration
was the dealing out of the offices to his followers and
henchmen. It was a bad scheme, from the political point of
view, for every President except him who inaugurated it.
Richelieu is reported to have said, on making an appointment,
&ldquo;I have made a hundred enemies and one ingrate.&rdquo;
So might have said many times the Presidents who succeeded
Jackson.</p>

<p>The Whig, a very respectable party, having in its ranks
the majority of the men of wealth and education, fell a
victim to the doctrine of availability when it nominated
Harrison on account of his military reputation. He lived
only one month after his inauguration, and Tyler, the Vice
President, who succeeded him, reverted to his old political
principles, which were Democratic, and broke with the
Whigs. By an adroit and steady use of the executive power
he effected the annexation of Texas, but the master spirit
in this enterprise was Calhoun, his Secretary of State.
Polk, his Democratic successor, coveted California and New
Mexico, tried to purchase them, and not being able to do
<a name="png.220" id="png.220"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">212</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>this, determined on war. In fact, he had decided to send
in a war message to Congress before the news came that the
Mexicans, goaded to it by the action of General Taylor,
under direct orders of the President, had attacked an American
force and killed sixteen of our dragoons. This gave
a different complexion to his message, and enabled him to
get a strong backing from Congress for his war policy. The
actions of Tyler and of Polk illustrate the power inherent
in the executive office. It might seem that the exercise
of this authority, securing for us at small material cost the
magnificent domains of Texas, California, and New Mexico,
would have given these Presidents a fame somewhat like
that which Jefferson won by the purchase of Louisiana.
But such has not been the case. The main reason is that
the extension of slavery was involved in both enterprises,
and the histories of these times, which have molded historical
sentiment, have been written from the <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'anti-slavery'">antislavery</ins>
point of view. It seems hardly probable that this sentiment
will be changed in any time that we can forecast, but
there is an undoubted tendency in the younger historical
students to look upon the expansion of the country as the
important consideration, and the slavery question as incidental.
Professor von Holst thought this changing historical
sentiment entirely natural, but he felt sure that in the
end men would come round to the antislavery view, of
which he was so powerful an advocate.</p>

<p>From Taylor to Lincoln slavery dominated all other
questions. Taylor was a Southern man and a slaveholder,
and by his course on the Compromise measures attracted
the favor of antislavery men; while Fillmore of New York,
who succeeded this second President to die in office, and
who exerted the power of the Administration to secure the
passage of Clay&#8217;s Compromise and signed the Fugitive
<a name="png.221" id="png.221"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">213</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Slave Law, had but a small political following at the North.
Pierce and Buchanan were weak, the more positive men
in their Cabinets and in the Senate swayed them. For a
part of both of their terms the House of Representatives
was controlled by the opposition, the Senate remaining
Democratic. These circumstances are evidence both of the
length of time required to change the political complexion
of the Senate and of the increasing power of the North,
which was dominant in the popular House. For the decade
before the Civil War we should study the Senate, the House
of Representatives, the Supreme Court, the action of the
states, and popular sentiment. The executive is still
powerful, but he is powerful because he is the representative
of a party or faction which dictates the use that shall be
made of his constitutional powers. The presidential office
loses interest: irresolute men are in the White House, strong
men everywhere else.</p>

<p>Lincoln is inaugurated President; the Civil War ensues,
and with it an extraordinary development of the executive
power. It is an interesting fact that the ruler of a republic
which sprang from a resistance to the English king and
Parliament should exercise more arbitrary power than any
Englishman since Oliver Cromwell, and that many of his
acts should be worthy of a Tudor. Lincoln was a good
lawyer who reverenced the Constitution and the laws, and
only through necessity assumed and exercised extra-legal
powers, trying at the same time to give to these actions the
color of legality. Hence his theory of the war power of the
Constitution, which may be construed to permit everything
necessary to carry on the war. Yet his dictatorship was
different from Cæsar&#8217;s and different from the absolute
authority of Napoleon. He acted under the restraints imposed
by his own legal conscience and patriotic soul, whose
<a name="png.222" id="png.222"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">214</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>influence was revealed in his confidential letters and talks.
We know furthermore that he often took counsel of his
Cabinet officers before deciding matters of moment. Certain
it is that in arbitrary arrests Seward and Stanton were
disposed to go further than Lincoln. The spirit of arbitrary
power was in the air, and unwise and unjust acts were
done by subordinates, which, although Lincoln would not
have done them himself, he deemed it better to ratify than
to undo. This was notably the case in the arrest of Vallandigham.
Again, Congress did not always do what Lincoln
wished, and certain men of his own party in Congress were
strong enough to influence his actions in various ways.
But, after all, he was himself a strong man exercising comprehensive
authority; and it is an example of the flexibility
of the Constitution that, while it surely did not authorize
certain of Lincoln&#8217;s acts, it did not expressly forbid
them. It was, for example, an open question whether the
Constitution authorized Congress or the President to suspend
the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>.</p>

<p>It seems to be pretty well settled by the common sense
of mankind that when a nation is fighting for its existence
it cannot be fettered by all the legal technicalities which
obtain in the time of peace. Happy the country whose
dictatorship, if dictator there must be, falls into wise and
honest hands! The honesty, magnanimity, and wisdom of
Lincoln guided him aright, and no harm has come to the
great principles of liberty from the arbitrary acts which he
did or suffered to be done. On the other hand he has so
impressed himself upon the Commonwealth that he has
made a precedent for future rulers in a time of national
peril, and what he excused and defended will be assumed
as a matter of course because it will be according to the
Constitution as interpreted by Abraham Lincoln. This the
<a name="png.223" id="png.223"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">215</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Supreme Court foresaw when it rendered its judgment in
the Milligan case, saying: &ldquo;Wicked men ambitious of
power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may
fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln,
and if this right is conceded [that of a commander in a time
of war to declare martial law within the lines of his military
district and subject citizens as well as soldiers to the rule of
<em>his will</em>] and the calamities of war again befall us, the dangers
to human liberty are frightful to contemplate.&rdquo; No
one can deny that a danger here exists, but it is not so great
as the solemn words of the Supreme Court might lead one
to believe. For Lincoln could not have persisted in his arbitrary
acts had a majority of Congress definitely opposed
them, and his real strength lay in the fact that he had the
people at his back. This may be said of the period from
the first call of troops in April, 1861, until the summer of
1862. McClellan&#8217;s failure on the Peninsula, Pope&#8217;s disaster
at the second battle of Bull Run, the defeats at Fredericksburg
and Chancellorsville lost Lincoln the confidence of
many; and while the emancipation proclamation of September,
1862, intensified the support of others, it nevertheless
alienated some Republicans and gave to the opposition
of the Democrats a new vigor. But after Gettysburg and
Vicksburg in July, 1863, Lincoln had the support of the mass
of the Northern people. Whatever he did the people believed
was right because he had done it. The trust each
placed in the other is one of the inspiring examples of free
government and democracy. Lincoln did not betray their
confidence: they did not falter save possibly for brief
moments during the gloomy summer of 1864. The people
who gave their unreserved support to Lincoln were endued
with intelligence and common sense; not attracted by any
personal magnetism of the man, they had, by a process of
<a name="png.224" id="png.224"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">216</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>homely reasoning, attained their convictions and from
these they were not to be shaken. This is the safety of a
dictatorship as long as the same intelligence obtains among
the voters as now; for the people will not support a ruler
in the exercise of extra-legal powers unless he be honest and
patriotic. The danger may come in a time of trouble from
either an irresolute or an unduly obstinate executive. The
irresolute man would baffle the best intentions of the voters;
the obstinate man might quarrel with Congress and the
people. Either event in time of war would be serious and
might be disastrous. But the chances are against another
Buchanan or Johnson in the presidential office.</p>

<p>If the Civil War showed the flexibility of the Constitution
in that the executive by the general agreement of Congress
and the people was able to assume unwarranted powers,
the course of affairs under Johnson demonstrated the
strength that Congress derived from the organic act. The
story is told in a sentence by Blaine: &ldquo;Two thirds of each
House united and stimulated to one end can practically
neutralize the executive power of the government and lay
down its policy in defiance of the efforts and opposition of
the President.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.4" name="fna.xiv.4"
 id="fna.xiv.4">4</a></sup> What a contrast between the two administrations!
Under Lincoln Congress, for the most part,
simply registered the will of the President; under Johnson
the President became a mere executive clerk of Congress.
In the one case the people supported the President, in the
other they sustained Congress. Nothing could better illustrate
the flexibility of the Constitution than the contrast
between these administrations; but it needs no argument
to show that to pass from one such extreme to another is
not healthy for the body politic. The violent antagonisms
aroused during Johnson&#8217;s administration, when the difficult
<a name="png.225" id="png.225"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">217</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>questions to be settled needed the best statesmanship of
the country, and when the President and Congress should
have coöperated wisely and sympathetically, did incalculable
harm. Johnson, by habits, manners, mind, and
character, was unfit for the presidential office, and whatever
may have been the merit of his policy, a policy devised by
angels could never have been carried on by such an advocate.
The American people love order and decency; they
have a high regard for the presidential office, and they desire
to see its occupant conduct himself with dignity. Jackson
and Lincoln lacked many of the external graces of a gentleman,
but both had native qualities which enabled them to
bear themselves with dignity on public occasions. Johnson
degraded the office, and he is the only one of our Presidents
of whom this can be said. Bagehot, writing in 1872, drew
an illustration from one of the darkest periods of our republic
to show the superiority of the English Constitution. If
we have a Prime Minister who does not suit Parliament and
the people, he argued, we remove him by a simple vote of
the House of Commons. The United States can only get
rid of its undesirable executive by a cumbrous and tedious
process which can only be brought to bear during a period
of revolutionary excitement; and even this failed because
a legal case was not made against the President. The criticism
was pregnant, but the remedy was not Cabinet responsibility.
Whatever may be the merits or demerits of
our polity, it has grown as has the English; it has fitted
itself to the people, and cabinet government cannot be had
without a complete change of the organic act, which is
neither possible nor desirable. The lesson was that the
national conventions should exercise more care in naming
their vice-presidential candidates; and these bodies have
heeded it. When Grant, popular throughout the country,
<a name="png.226" id="png.226"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">218</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>nominated by the unanimous vote of the Republican convention,
became President, Congress restored to the executive
a large portion of the powers of which it had been shorn
during Johnson&#8217;s administration. Grant had splendid opportunities
which he did not improve, and he left no especial
impression on the office. In the opinion of one of his warm
friends and supporters he made &ldquo;a pretty poor President.&rdquo;
An able opposition to him developed in his own party; and
as he was a sensitive man he felt keenly their attacks. Colonel
John Hay told me that, when on a visit to Washington
during Grant&#8217;s administration, he had arrived at the Arlington
Hotel at an early hour and started out for a walk; in
front of the White House he was surprised to meet the
President, who was out for the same purpose. The two
walked together to the Capitol and back, Grant showing
himself to be anything but a silent man. Manifesting a keen
sensitiveness to the attacks upon him, he talked all of the
time in a voluble manner, and the burden of his talk was a
defense of his administrative acts. It is impossible in our
minds to dissociate Grant the President from Grant the
General, and for this reason American historical criticism
will deal kindly with him. The brilliant victor of Donelson,
the bold strategist of Vicksburg, the compeller of men at
Chattanooga, the vanquisher of Robert E. Lee in March and
April, 1865, the magnanimous conqueror at Appomattox,
will be treated with charity by those who write about his
presidential terms, because he meant well although he did
not know how to do well. Moreover, the good which Grant
did is of that salient kind which will not be forgotten. The
victorious general, with two trusted military subordinates
in the prime of life and a personnel for a strong navy, persisted,
under the guidance of his wise Secretary of State,
Hamilton Fish, in negotiating a treaty which provided for
<a name="png.227" id="png.227"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">219</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>arbitration and preserved the peace with Great Britain;
although, in the opinion of the majority, the country had a
just cause of war in the escape of the Florida and the Alabama.
After the panic of 1873, when financiers and capitalists
lost their heads, and Congress with the approval of
public sentiment passed an act increasing the amount of
United States notes in circulation, Grant, by a manly and
bold veto, prevented this inflation of the currency. The
wisdom of the framers of the Constitution in giving the
President the veto power was exemplified. Congress did not
pass the act over the veto, and Grant has been justified by
the later judgment of the nation. His action demonstrated
what a President may do in resisting by his constitutional
authority some transitory wave of popular opinion, and it
has proved a precedent of no mean value. Johnson&#8217;s vetoes
became ridiculous. Grant&#8217;s veto compensates for many
of his mistakes.</p>

<p>Said Chancellor Kent in 1826: &ldquo;If ever the tranquillity of
this nation is to be disturbed and its liberties endangered by
a struggle for power, it will be upon this very subject of the
choice of a President. This is the question that is eventually
to test the goodness and try the strength of the Constitution,
and if we shall be able for half a century hereafter
to continue to elect the chief magistrate of the Union with
discretion, moderation, and integrity we shall undoubtedly
stamp the highest value on our national character.&rdquo; Just
fifty years later came a more dangerous test than Kent
could have imagined. Somewhat more than half of the
country believed that the states of Florida and Louisiana
should be counted for Tilden, and that he was therefore
elected. On the other hand, nearly one half of the voters
were of the opinion that those electoral votes should be
given to Hayes, which would elect him by the majority of
<a name="png.228" id="png.228"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">220</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>one electoral vote. Each of the parties had apparently a
good case, and after an angry controversy became only the
more firmly and sincerely convinced that its own point of
view was unassailable. The Senate was Republican, the
House Democratic. The great Civil War had been ended
only eleven years before, and the country was full of fighting
men. The Southern people were embittered against the
dominant party for the reason that Reconstruction had
gone otherwise than they had expected in 1865 when they
laid down their arms. The country was on the verge of a
civil war over the disputed Presidency&mdash;a war that might
have begun with an armed encounter on the floor of the
Senate or the House. This was averted by a carefully
prepared congressional act, which in effect left the dispute
to a board of arbitration. To the statesmen of both parties
who devised this plan and who coöperated in carrying the
measure through Congress; to the members of the Electoral
Commission, who in the bitterest strife conducted themselves
with dignity; to the Democratic Speaker of the House
and the Democrats who followed his lead, the eternal gratitude
of the country is due. &ldquo;He that ruleth his spirit is
better than he that taketh a city.&rdquo; The victories of Manila
and Santiago are as nothing compared with the victorious
restraint of the American people in 1876 and 1877 and the
acquiescence of one half of the country in what they believed
to be an unrighteous decision. Hayes was inaugurated
peacefully, but had to conduct his administration in
the view of 4,300,000 voters who believed that, whatever
might be his legal claim, he had no moral right to the place
he occupied. The Democrats controlled the House of Representatives
during the whole of his term, and the Senate
for a part of it, and at the outset he encountered the opposition
of the stalwart faction of his own party. Nevertheless
<a name="png.229" id="png.229"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">221</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>he made a successful President, and under him the office
gained in force and dignity. Hayes was not a man of brilliant
parts or wide intelligence, but he had common sense
and decision of character. Surrounding himself with a
strong Cabinet, three members of which were really remarkable
for their ability, he entered upon a distinct policy from
which flowed good results. He withdrew the Federal troops
from the states of South Carolina and Louisiana, inaugurating
in these states an era of comparative peace and tranquillity.
Something was done in the interest of Civil
Service Reform. In opposition to the view of his Secretary
of the Treasury and confidential friend, John Sherman, he
vetoed the act of 1878 for the remonetization of silver by
the coinage of a certain amount of silver dollars&mdash;the first
of those measures which almost brought us to the monetary
basis of silver. His guiding principle was embodied in a
remark he made in his inaugural address, &ldquo;He serves his
party best who serves the country best.&rdquo; He and his accomplished
wife had a social and moral influence in Washington
of no mean value. The Civil War had been followed
by a period of corruption, profligacy, and personal immorality.
In politics, if a man were sound on the main question,
which meant if he were a thorough-going Republican, all
else was forgiven. Under Hayes account was again taken
of character and fitness. The standard of political administration
was high. While Mrs. Hayes undoubtedly carried
her total abstinence principles to an extreme not warranted
by the usage of good society, the moral atmosphere of the
White House was that of most American homes. Mr. and
Mrs. Hayes belonged to that large class who are neither rich
nor poor, neither learned nor ignorant, but who are led both
by their native common sense and by their upbringing to
have a high respect for learning, a belief in education,
<a name="png.230" id="png.230"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">222</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>morality, and religion, and a lofty ideal for their own personal
conduct.</p>

<p>The salient feature of Garfield&#8217;s few months of administration
was a quarrel between him and the senators from
New York State about an important appointment. Into
this discussion, which ended in a tragedy, entered so many
factors that it is impossible to determine exactly the influence
on the power of the President and the growing power
of the Senate. One important result of it shall be mentioned.
The Civil Service Reform Bill, introduced into the
Senate by a Democrat, was enacted during Arthur&#8217;s administration
by a large and non-partisan majority. It provided
for a non-partisan civil service commission, and
established open competitive examinations for applicants
for certain offices, making a commencement by law of the
merit system, which before had depended entirely upon
executive favor. It was a victory for reformers who had
been advocating legislation of such a character from a
period shortly after the close of the Civil War; for it was
at that time that a few began the work of educating public
sentiment, which had acquiesced in the rotation of offices
as an American principle well worthy of maintenance.
Consequences far-reaching and wholesome followed the
passage of this important act. Grant had attempted and
Hayes had accomplished a measure of reform, but to really
fix the merit system in the civil service a law was needed.</p>

<p>Regarded by the lovers of good government as a machine
politician, Arthur happily disappointed them by breaking
loose from his old associations and pursuing a manly course.
He gave the country a dignified administration; but, even
had he been a man to impress his character upon the office,
conditions were against him. His party was torn by internal
dissensions and suffered many defeats, of which the
<a name="png.231" id="png.231"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">223</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>most notable was in his own state of New York, where his
Secretary of the Treasury and personal friend was overwhelmingly
defeated for governor by Grover Cleveland.</p>

<p>The unprecedented majority which Cleveland received
in this election and his excellent administration as Governor
of New York secured for him the Democratic nomination
for President in 1884. New York State decided the
election, but the vote was so close that for some days the
result was in doubt and the country was nervous lest there
should be another disputed Presidency; in the end it was
determined that Cleveland had carried that state by a
plurality of 1149. Cleveland was the first Democratic
President elected since 1856; the Democrats had been out
of office for twenty-four years, and it had galled them to
think that their historic party had so long been deprived of
power and patronage. While many of their leaders had a
good record on the question of Civil Service Reform, the
rank and file believed in the Jacksonian doctrine of rewarding
party workers with the offices, or, as most of them would
have put it, &ldquo;To the victors belong the spoils.&rdquo; With this
principle so fixed in the minds of his supporters, it became
an interesting question how Cleveland would meet it. No
one could doubt that he would enforce fairly the statute, but
would he content himself with this and use the offices not
covered by the act to reward his followers in the old Democratic
fashion? An avowed civil service reformer, and
warmly supported by independents and some former Republicans
on that account, he justified the confidence which
they had reposed in him and refused &ldquo;to make a clean
sweep.&rdquo; In resisting this very powerful pressure from his
party he accomplished much toward the establishment
of the merit system in the civil service. It is true that he
made political changes gradually, but his insistence on a rule
<a name="png.232" id="png.232"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">224</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which gained him time for reflection in making appointments
was of marked importance. It would be idle to
assert that in his two terms he lived wholly up to the ideal
of the reformers; undoubtedly a long list of backslidings
might be made up, but in striking a fair balance it is not too
much to say that in this respect his administration made
for righteousness. All the more credit is due him in that he
not only resisted personal pressure, but, aspiring to be a
party leader for the carrying out of a cherished policy on
finance and the tariff, he made more difficult the accomplishment
of these ends by refusing to be a mere partisan
in the question of the offices. In his second term it is
alleged, probably with truth, that he made a skillful use of
his patronage to secure the passage by the Senate of the
repeal of the Silver Act of 1890, which repeal had gone easily
through the House. It seemed to him and to many financiers
that unless this large purchase of silver bullion should
be stopped the country would be forced on to a silver basis,
the existing financial panic would be grievously intensified,
and the road back to the sound money basis of the rest of
the civilized world would be long and arduous. His course
is defended as doing a little wrong in order to bring about
a great right; and the sequence of events has justified that
defense. Harm was done to the cause of Civil Service
Reform, but probably no permanent injury. The repeal of
the Silver Act of 1890 was the first important step in
the direction of insuring a permanent gold standard, and
Grover Cleveland is the hero of it.</p>

<p>The presidential office gained in strength during Cleveland&#8217;s
two terms. As we look back upon them, the President
is the central figure round which revolves each policy
and its success or failure. At the same time, it is his party
more than he that is to be blamed for the failures. He
<a name="png.233" id="png.233"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">225</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>made a distinct move toward a reduction of the tariff, and
while this failed, leaving us with the reactionary result of
higher duties than ever before, it is not impossible that the
words, actions, and sacrifices of Cleveland will be the foundation
of a new tariff-reform party. Allusion has been
made to his soundness on finance. His course in this respect
was unvarying. Capitalists and financiers can take
care of themselves, no matter what are the changes in the
currency; but men and women of fixed incomes, professors
of colleges, teachers in schools, clergymen and ministers,
accountants and clerks in receipt of salaries, and
farmers and laborers have had their comfort increased and
their anxieties lessened by the adoption of the gold standard;
and to Cleveland, as one of the pioneers in this movement
for stability, their thanks are due.</p>

<p>In the railroad riots of 1894 Cleveland, under the advice
of his able Attorney-General, made a precedent in the way
of interference for the supremacy of law and the maintenance
of order. The Governor of Illinois would not preserve
order, and the President determined that at all hazards
riotous acts must be suppressed and law must resume its
sway. In ordering United States troops to the scene of the
disturbance without an application of the Legislature or
Governor of Illinois he accomplished a fresh extension of
executive power without an infraction of the Constitution.</p>

<p>In his most important diplomatic action Cleveland was not
so happy as in his domestic policy. There are able men
experienced in diplomacy who defend his message of December
17, 1895, to Congress in regard to Venezuela, and the
wisdom of that action is still a mooted question. Yet two
facts placed in juxtaposition would seem to indicate that
the message was a mistake. It contained a veiled threat of
war if England would not arbitrate her difference with
<a name="png.234" id="png.234"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">226</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Venezuela, the implication being that the stronger power was
trying to browbeat the weaker one. Later an arbitration
took place, the award of which was a compromise, England
gaining more than Venezuela, and the award demonstrated
that England had not been as extreme and unjust in her
claim as had been Venezuela. It is even probable that
England might have accepted, as the result of negotiation,
the line decided on by the arbitrators. But, to the credit of
Mr. Cleveland and his Secretary of State, Mr. Olney, it must
be remembered that they later negotiated a treaty &ldquo;for the
arbitration of all matters in difference between the United
States and Great Britain,&rdquo; which unfortunately failed of
ratification by the Senate.</p>

<p>It is a fair charge against Cleveland as a partisan leader
that, while he led a strong following to victory in 1892, he
left his party disorganized in 1897. But it fell to him to
decide between principle and party, and he chose principle.
He served his country at the expense of his party. From
the point of view of Democrats it was grievous that the only
man under whom they had secured victory since the Civil
War should leave them in a shattered condition, and it may
be a question whether a ruler of more tact could not have
secured his ends without so great a schism. Those, however,
to whom this party consideration does not appeal have
no difficulty in approving Cleveland&#8217;s course. It is undeniable
that his character is stamped on the presidential
office, and his occupancy of it is a distinct mark in the history
of executive power.</p>

<p>Harrison occupied the presidential office between the two
terms of Cleveland, and although a positive man, left no
particular impress upon the office. He was noted for his
excellent judicial appointments, and he had undoubtedly
a high standard of official conduct which he endeavored to
<a name="png.235" id="png.235"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">227</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>live up to. Cold in his personal bearing he did not attract
friends, and he was not popular with the prominent men in
his own party. While Cleveland and McKinley were denounced
by their opponents, Harrison was ridiculed; but
the universal respect in which he was held after he retired
to private life is evidence that the great office lost no dignity
while he held it. During his term Congress overshadowed
the executive and the House was more conspicuous
than the Senate. Thomas B. Reed was speaker and developed
the power of that office to an extraordinary extent.
McKinley was the leader of the House and from long service
in that body had become an efficient leader. The election
of Harrison was interpreted to mean that the country
needed a higher tariff, and McKinley carried through the
House the bill which is known by his name. Among the
other Representatives Mr. Lodge was prominent. It was
not an uncommon saying at that time that the House was
a better arena for the rising politician than the Senate. In
addition to the higher tariff the country apparently wanted
more silver and a determined struggle was made for the
free coinage of silver which nearly won in Congress. In the
end, however, a compromise was effected by Senator Sherman
which averted free silver but committed the country
to the purchase annually of an enormous amount of silver
bullion against which Treasury notes redeemable in coin
were issued. This was the Act of 1890 which, as I have
mentioned, was repealed under Cleveland in 1893. It is
entirely clear from the sequence of events that the Republican
party as a party should have opposed the purchase of
more silver. It could not have been beaten worse than it
was in 1892, but it could have preserved a consistency in
principle which, when the tide turned, would have been of
political value. The party which has stuck to the right
<a name="png.236" id="png.236"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">228</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>principle has in the long run generally been rewarded with
power, and as the Republicans, in spite of certain defections,
had been the party of sound money since the Civil War,
they should now have fought cheap money under the guise
of unlimited silver as they had before under the guise of unlimited
greenbacks. But the leaders thought differently,
and from their own point of view their course was natural.
The country desired more silver. Business was largely
extended, overtrading was the rule. Farmers and business
men were straitened for money. Economists, statesmen,
and politicians had told them that, as their trouble had come
largely from the demonetization of silver, their relief lay in
bimetallism. It was easy to argue that the best form of
bimetallism was the free coinage of gold and silver, and after
the panic of 1893 this delusion grew, but the strength of it
was hardly appreciated by optimistic men in the East until
the Democrats made it the chief plank in the platform on
which they fought the presidential campaign of 1896. Nominating
an orator who had an effective manner of presenting
his arguments to hard-working farmers whose farms were
mortgaged, to business men who were under a continued
strain to meet their obligations, and to laborers out of employment,
it seemed for two or three months as if the party
of silver and discontent might carry the day. After some
hesitation the Republicans grappled with the question boldly,
took ground against free silver, and with some modification
declared their approval of the gold standard. On this
issue they fought the campaign. Their able and adroit
manager was quick to see, after the issue was joined, the force
of the principle of sound money and started a remarkable
campaign of education by issuing speeches and articles by
the millions in a number of different languages, in providing
excellent arguments for the country press, and in convincing
<a name="png.237" id="png.237"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">229</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>those who would listen only to arguments of sententious
brevity by a well-devised circulation of &ldquo;nuggets&rdquo; of financial
wisdom. McKinley had also the support of the greater
part of the Independent and Democratic press. While
financial magnates and the bankers of the country were
alarmed at the strength of the Bryan party, and felt that
its defeat was necessary to financial surety, the strength of
the Republican canvass lay in the fact that the speakers and
writers who made it believed sincerely that the gold standard
would conduce to the greatest good of the greatest number.
It was an inspiring canvass. The honest advocacy of sound
principle won.</p>

<p>Under McKinley the Democratic tariff bill was superseded
by the Dingley act, which on dutiable articles is, I
believe, the highest tariff the country has known. The
Republican party believes sincerely in the policy of protection,
and the country undoubtedly has faith in it. It is
attractive to those who allow immediate returns to obscure
prospective advantage, and if a majority decides whether
or not a political and economic doctrine is sound, it has a
powerful backing, for every large country in the civilized
world, I think, except England, adheres to protection; and
some of them have returned to it after trying a measure of
commercial freedom. McKinley and the majority of Congress
were in full sympathy, and the Dingley act had the
approval of the administration. But the change in business
conditions which, though long in operation, became signally
apparent after 1893, wrought in McKinley, during his four
and a half years of office, a change of opinion. Under improved
processes and economies in all branches of manufactures
the United States began to make many articles
cheaper than any other country, and sought foreign markets
for its surplus, disputing successfully certain open marts
<a name="png.238" id="png.238"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">230</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with England and Germany. In McKinley&#8217;s earlier utterances
the home market is the dominating feature; in his
later ones, trade with foreign countries. In his last speech
at Buffalo he gave mature expression to his views, which
for one who had been a leader of protectionists showed him
to have taken advanced ground. &ldquo;We find our long-time
principles echoed,&rdquo; declared the <cite>Nation</cite>. McKinley&#8217;s manner
of developing foreign trade was not that of the tariff
reformers, for he proposed to bring this about by a variety
of reciprocity treaties; but it was important that he recognized
the sound economic principle that if we are to sell to
foreign countries we must buy from them also. That
McKinley had a strong hold on the country is indisputable
from the unanimous renomination by his party and his
triumphant reëlection, and it was a step toward commercial
freedom that he who more than all other men had the
ear of the country and who had been an arch-protectionist
should advocate the exchange of commodities with foreign
lands. Economists do not educate the mass of voters, but
men like McKinley do, and these sentences of his were read
and pondered by millions: &ldquo;A system which provides a
mutual exchange of commodities is manifestly essential to
the continued and healthful growth of our export trade.
We must not repose in fancied security that we can forever
sell everything and buy little or nothing. If such a thing
were possible it would not be best for us or for those with
whom we deal.&rdquo; It is useless to speculate on what would
have been the result had McKinley lived. Those who considered
him a weak President aver that when he encountered
opposition in Congress from interests which were seemingly
menaced, he would have yielded and abandoned reciprocity.
Others believe that he understood the question thoroughly
and that his arguments would in the end have prevailed
<a name="png.239" id="png.239"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">231</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with Congress; yielding, perhaps, in points of detail he would
have secured the adoption of the essential part of his policy.</p>

<p>After his election McKinley became a believer in the gold
standard and urged proper legislation upon Congress. It
is to his credit and to that of Congress that on March 14,
1900, a bill became a law which establishes the gold standard
and puts it out of the power of any President to place the
country upon a silver basis by a simple direction to his
Secretary of the Treasury, which could have been done in
1897. As it has turned out, it was fortunate that there was
no undue haste in this financial legislation. A better act
was obtained than would have been possible in the first two
years of McKinley&#8217;s administration. The reaction from the
crisis following the panic of 1893 had arrived, made sure
by the result of the election of 1896; and the prosperity had
become a telling argument in favor of the gold standard
with the people and with Congress.</p>

<p>McKinley was essentially adapted for a peace minister,
but under him came war. Opinions of him will differ, not
only according to one&#8217;s sentiments on war and imperialism,
but according to one&#8217;s ideal of what a President should be.
Let us make a comparison which shall not include Washington,
for the reason that under him the country had not
become the pure democracy it is at the present day. Of
such a democracy it seems to me that Lincoln is the ideal
President, in that he led public sentiment, represented it,
and followed it. &ldquo;I claim not to have controlled events,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but confess plainly that events have controlled
me.&rdquo; During his term of office he was one day called &ldquo;very
weak,&rdquo; and the next &ldquo;a tyrant&rdquo;; but when his whole work
was done, a careful survey of it could bring one only to the
conclusion that he knew when to follow and when to lead.
He was in complete touch with popular sentiment, and
<a name="png.240" id="png.240"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">232</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>divined with nicety when he could take a step in advance.
He made an effort to keep on good terms with Congress, and
he differed with that body reluctantly, although, when the
necessity came, decisively. While he had consideration
for those who did not agree with him, and while he acted
always with a regard to proportion, he was nevertheless a
strong and self-confident executive. Now Cleveland did
not comprehend popular opinion as did Lincoln. In him
the desire to lead was paramount, to the exclusion at times
of a proper consideration for Congress and the people. It
has been said by one of his political friends that he used the
same energy and force in deciding a small matter as a great
one, and he alienated senators, congressmen, and other
supporters by an unyielding disposition when no principle
was involved. He did not possess the gracious quality of
Lincoln, who yielded in small things that he might prevail
in great ones. Yet for this quality of sturdy insistence on
his own idea Cleveland has won admiration from a vast
number of independent thinkers. Temperaments such as
these are not in sympathy with McKinley, who represents
another phase of Lincoln&#8217;s genius. The controlling idea of
McKinley probably was that as he was elected by the people
he should represent them. He did not believe that, if a
matter were fully and fairly presented, the people would
go wrong. At times he felt he should wait for their sober,
second thought, but if, after due consideration, the people
spoke, it was his duty to carry out their will. Unquestionably
if the Cleveland and McKinley qualities can be
happily combined as they were in Lincoln, the nearest possible
approach to the ideal ruler is the result. One Lincoln,
though, in a century, is all that any country can expect:
and there is a place in our polity for either the Cleveland or
the McKinley type of executive. So it seemed to the makers
<a name="png.241" id="png.241"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">233</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of the Constitution. &ldquo;The republican principle,&rdquo; wrote
Hamilton in the <cite>Federalist</cite>, &ldquo;demands that the deliberate
sense of the community should govern the conduct of those
to whom they intrust the management of their affairs.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said in the same essay, &ldquo;however inclined we
might be to insist upon an unbounded complaisance in the
executive to the inclinations of the people, we can with no
propriety contend for a like complaisance to the humors of
the legislature&hellip;. The executive should be in a situation
to dare to act his own opinion with vigor and decision.&rdquo;
It is frequently remarked that no President since Lincoln
had so thorough a comprehension of public sentiment as
McKinley. This knowledge and his theory of action, if I
have divined it aright, are an explanation of his course in
regard to the Spanish War and the taking of the Philippines.
It does not fall to me to discuss in this article these two questions,
nor do I feel certain that all the documents necessary
to a fair judgment are accessible to the public, but I can
show what was McKinley&#8217;s attitude toward them by reporting
a confidential conversation he had on May 2, 1899, with
Mr. Henry S. Pritchett, president of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, who made a record of it the day
afterward. The President, Mr. Pritchett relates, spoke of
the &ldquo;war and of his own responsibility, and the way in
which he has gradually come to have his present position
with respect to the Philippines. The talk was started by
my reminding him of the fact that just a year ago that morning,
on May 2, 1898, I had come into his room with a map
of Manila and Cavité on a large scale&mdash;the first time he had
seen such a map&mdash;and from this he drifted into a most
serious and interesting talk of his own place in the history of
the past twelve months. He described his efforts to avert
the war, how he had carried the effort to the point of
<a name="png.242" id="png.242"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">234</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>rupture with his party, then came the Maine incident, and,
finally, a declaration of war over all efforts to stem the tide.
Then he spoke of Cuba and Porto Rico and the Philippines,
related at some length the correspondence he had had with
the Paris Commission, how he had been gradually made to
feel in his struggling for the right ground that first Luzon
and finally all the Philippines must be kept. He then went
on to indicate his belief that Providence had led in all this
matter, that to him the march of events had been so irresistible
that nothing could turn them aside. Nobody, he said,
could have tried harder than he to be rid of the burden of
the Philippines, and yet the trend of events had been such
that it seemed impossible to escape this duty. He finally
came to speak with more emotion than I have ever seen him
exhibit, and no one could doubt the sincerity of the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of McKinley&#8217;s achievements in the field of diplomacy
Secretary Hay in his memorial address spoke with knowledge
and in words of high praise. Sometimes the expression
of a careful foreign observer anticipates the judgment of
posterity, and with that view the words of the <cite>Spectator</cite>,<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.5"
 name="fna.xiv.5" id="fna.xiv.5">5</a></sup>
in an article on the presidential election of 1900, are worth
quoting: &ldquo;We believe that Mr. McKinley and the wise
statesman who is his Secretary of State, Colonel Hay, are
administrators of a high order. They have learnt their
business thoroughly, hold all the strings of policy in their
hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Opinions will differ as to the impress McKinley has left
on the presidential office. It is the judgment of two men of
large knowledge of American history and present affairs
that no President since Jefferson has been so successful in
getting Congress to adopt the positive measures he desired.</p>

<p>Of the administration of Theodore Roosevelt it would be
<a name="png.243" id="png.243"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">235</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>neither proper nor wise for me to speak in other terms than
those of expectation and prophecy. But of Mr. Roosevelt
himself something may be said. His birth, breeding, education,
and social advantages have been of the best. He has
led an industrious and useful life. As an American citizen
we are all proud of him, and when he reached the presidential
office by a tragedy that nobody deplored more than
he, every one wished him success. His transparent honesty
and sincerity are winning qualities, and in the opinion of
Burke especially important in him who is the ruler of a nation.
&ldquo;Plain good intention,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;which is as easily
discovered at the first view as fraud is surely detected at
last, is, let me say, of no mean force in the government of
mankind.&rdquo; To these qualities, and to a physical and moral
courage that can never be questioned, Mr. Roosevelt adds
a large intelligence and, as his books show, a power of combination
of ideas and cohesive thought. Moreover, he has
had a good political training, and he has the faculty of
writing his political papers in a pregnant and forcible literary
style. He is fit for what Mr. Bryce calls &ldquo;the greatest office
in the world, unless we except the Papacy.&rdquo; His ideals are
Washington and Lincoln. &ldquo;I like to see in my mind&#8217;s eye,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;the gaunt form of Lincoln stalking through these
halls.&rdquo; &ldquo;To gratify the hopes, secure the reverence, and
sustain the dignity of the nation,&rdquo; said Justice Story, &ldquo;the
presidential office should always be occupied by a man of
elevated talents, of ripe virtues, of incorruptible integrity,
and of tried patriotism; one who shall forget his own interests
and remember that he represents not a party but the
whole nation.&rdquo; These qualities Theodore Roosevelt has.
Whether he shall in action carry out the other requirements
of Justice Story may only be judged after he shall have
retired to private life.</p>

<p><a name="png.244" id="png.244"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">236</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mr. Roosevelt merits the encouragement and sympathy
of all lovers of good government, and he is entitled, as
indeed is every President, to considerate and forbearing
criticism. For, ardently desired as the office is, it is a hard
place to fill. Through the kindness of President Roosevelt,
I have been enabled to observe the daily routine of his work,
and I am free to say that from the business point of view,
no man better earns his pay than does he. Mr. Bryce remarks
that a good deal of the President&#8217;s work is like that
of the manager of a railway. So far as concerns the consultation
with heads of departments, prompt decisions,
and the disposition of daily matters, the comparison is apt,
if a great American railway and a manager like Thomas A.
Scott are borne in mind. But the railway manager&#8217;s
labor is done in comparative privacy, he can be free from
interruption and dispose of his own time in a systematic
manner. That is impossible for the President during the
session of Congress. Office-seekers themselves do not
trouble the President so much as in former days; they may
be referred to the heads of the departments; and, moreover,
the introduction of competitive examinations and the merit
system has operated as a relief to the President and his
Cabinet officers. But hearing the recommendations by
senators and congressmen of their friends for offices consumes
a large amount of time. There are, as Senator Lodge
has kindly informed me, 4818 presidential offices exclusive
of 4000 presidential post offices; in addition there are
army and naval officers to be appointed. The proper selection
in four years of the number of men these figures imply
is in itself no small labor; it would by a railway manager
be considered an onerous and exacting business. But the
railway manager may hear the claims of applicants in his
own proper way, and to prevent encroachments on his time
<a name="png.245" id="png.245"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">237</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>may give the candidates or their friends a curt dismissal.
The President may not treat senators and representatives
in that manner, nor would he desire to do so, for the intercourse
between them and the executive is of great value.
&ldquo;The President,&rdquo; wrote John Sherman, &ldquo;should &lsquo;touch
elbows&rsquo; with Congress.&rdquo; There are important legislative
measures to be discussed in a frank interchange of opinion.
Senators and representatives are a guide to the President
in their estimates of public sentiment; often they exert
an influence over him, and he is dependent on them for the
carrying out of any policy he may have at heart. While
the encroachments on the President&#8217;s time are great, I am
convinced that no plan should be adopted which should
curtail the unconventional and frank interchange of views
between the President and members of the National Legislature.
The relief lies with the public. Much of the President&#8217;s
time is taken up with receptions of the friends of
senators and representatives, of members of conventions
and learned bodies meeting in Washington, of deputations
of school-teachers and the like who have gone to the capital
for a holiday: all desire to pay their respects to the Chief
Magistrate. Undoubtedly, if he could have a quiet talk
with most of these people, it would be of value, but the conventional
shaking of hands and the &ldquo;I am glad to see you&rdquo;
is not a satisfaction great enough to the recipients to pay
for what it costs the President in time and the expenditure
of nervous force. He should have time for deliberation.
The railway manager can closet himself when he likes:
that should be the privilege of the President; yet on a certain
day last April, when he wished to have a long confidential
talk with his Secretary of War, this was only to be
contrived by the two taking a long horseback ride in the
country. It is difficult for the President to refuse to see
<a name="png.246" id="png.246"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">238</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>these good, patriotic, and learned people; and senators and
representatives like to gratify their constituents. The
remedy lies with the public in denying themselves this
pleasant feature of a visit to Washington. One does not
call on the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad or the
president of the New York Central Railroad in business
hours unless for business purposes; and this should be the
rule observed by citizens of the United States toward the
President. The weekly public receptions are no longer
held. All these other receptions and calls simply for shaking
hands and wishing him God-speed should no longer be
asked for. For the President has larger and more serious
work than the railway manager and should have at least as
much time for thought and deliberation.</p>

<p>Moreover, the work of the railway manager is done in
secret. Fiercer by far than the light which beats upon the
throne is that which beats upon the White House. The
people are eager to know the President&#8217;s thoughts and plans,
and an insistent press endeavors to satisfy them. Considering
the conditions under which the President does his
work, the wonder is not that he makes so many mistakes,
but that he makes so few. There is no railway or business
manager or college president who has not more time to himself
for the reflection necessary to the maturing of large and
correct policies. I chanced to be in the President&#8217;s room
when he dictated the rough draft of his famous dispatch to
General Chaffee respecting torture in the Philippines. While
he was dictating, two or three cards were brought in, also
some books with a request for the President&#8217;s autograph,
and there were some other interruptions. While the dispatch
as it went out in its revised form could not be improved,
a President cannot expect to be always so happy
in dictating dispatches in the midst of distractions. Office
<a name="png.247" id="png.247"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">239</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>work of far-reaching importance should be done in the closet.
Certainly no monarch or minister in Europe does administrative
work under such unfavorable conditions; indeed,
this public which exacts so much of the President&#8217;s time
should in all fairness be considerate in its criticism.</p>

<p>No one, I think, would care to have abated the fearless
political criticism which has in this country and in England
attained to the highest point ever reached. From the nature
of things the press must comment promptly and without
the full knowledge of conditions that might alter its judgments.
But on account of the necessary haste of its expressions,
the writers should avoid extravagant language and
the too ready imputation of bad motives to the public servants.
&ldquo;It is strange that men cannot allow others to differ
with them without charging corruption as the cause of the
difference,&rdquo; are the plaintive words of Grant during a confidential
conversation with his Secretary of State.</p>

<p>The contrast between the savage criticism of Cleveland
and Harrison while each occupied the presidential chair
and the respect each enjoyed from political opponents after
retiring to private life is an effective illustration of the lesson
I should like to teach. At the time of Harrison&#8217;s death
people spoke from their hearts and said, &ldquo;Well done, good
and faithful servant.&rdquo; A fine example of political criticism
in a time of great excitement were two articles by Mr. Carl
Schurz in <cite>Harper&#8217;s Weekly</cite> during the Venezuela crisis.
Mr. Schurz was a supporter and political friend of Cleveland,
but condemned his Venezuela message. In the articles to
which I refer he was charitable in feeling and moderate in
tone, and though at the time I heard the term &ldquo;wishy-washy&rdquo;
applied to one of them, I suspect that Mr. Schurz
now looks back with satisfaction to his reserve; and those
of us who used more forcible language in regard to the
<a name="png.248" id="png.248"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">240</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>same incident may well wish that we had emulated his
moderation.</p>

<p>The presidential office differs from all other political
offices in the world, and has justified the hopes of its creators.
It has not realized their fears, one of which was expressed
by Hamilton in the <cite>Federalist</cite>. &ldquo;A man raised from
the station of a private citizen to the rank of Chief Magistrate,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;possessed of a moderate or slender fortune,
and looking forward to a period not very remote, when
he may probably be obliged to return to the station from
which he was taken, might sometimes be under temptations
to sacrifice his duty to his interest, which it would require
superlative virtue to withstand. An avaricious man might
be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition
of wealth. An ambitious man might make his
own aggrandizement, by the aid of a foreign power, the
price of his treachery to his constituents.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.6"
 name="fna.xiv.6" id="fna.xiv.6">6</a></sup> From dangers
of this sort the political virtue which we inherited from our
English ancestors has preserved us. We may fairly maintain
that the creation and administration of our presidential
office have added something to political history, and
when we contrast in character and ability the men who have
filled it with the monarchs of England and of France, we
may have a feeling of just pride. Mr. Bryce makes a suggestive
comparison in ability of our Presidents to the
prime ministers of England, awarding the palm to the
Englishmen,<sup><a href="#fn.xiv.7" name="fna.xiv.7"
 id="fna.xiv.7">7</a></sup> and from his large knowledge of both countries
and impartial judgment we may readily accept his
conclusion. It is, however, a merit of our Constitution that
as great ability is not required for its chief executive office
as is demanded in England. The prime minister must have
<a name="png.249" id="png.249"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">241</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a talent for both administration and debate, which is a
rare combination of powers, and if he be chosen from the
House of Commons, it may happen that too much stress will
be laid upon oratory, or the power of making ready replies
to the attacks of the opposition. It is impossible to conceive
of Washington defending his policy in the House or the Senate
from a fire of questions and cross-questions. Lincoln
might have developed this quality of a prime minister, but
his replies and sallies of wit to put to confusion his opponents
would have lacked the dignity his state papers
and confidential letters possess. Hayes and Cleveland were
excellent administrators, but neither could have reached
his high position had the debating ability of a prime minister
been required. On the other hand, Garfield, Harrison,
and McKinley would have been effective speakers in either
the House or the Senate.</p>

<p>An American may judge his own country best from European
soil, impregnated as he there is with European ideas.
Twice have I been in Europe during Cleveland&#8217;s administration,
twice during McKinley&#8217;s, once during Roosevelt&#8217;s.
During the natural process of comparison, when one must
recognize in many things the distinct superiority of England,
Germany, and France, I have never had a feeling other
than high respect for each one of these Presidents; and
taking it by and large, in the endeavor to consider fairly
the hits and misses of all, I have never had any reason to
feel that the conduct of our national government has been
inferior to that of any one of these highly civilized powers.</p>

 /></span>A REVIEW OF PRESIDENT HAYES&#8217;S ADMINISTRATION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> of our Presidents have been inaugurated under
curious and trying circumstances, but no one of them except
Hayes has taken the oath of office when there was a
cloud on his title. Every man who had voted for Tilden,&mdash;whose
popular vote exceeded that of Hayes by 264,000,&mdash;believed
that Hayes had reached his high place by means of
fraud. Indeed, some of the Hayes voters shared this belief,
and stigmatized as monstrous the action of the Louisiana
returning board in awarding the electoral vote of Louisiana
to Hayes. The four men, three of them dishonest and the
fourth incompetent, who constituted this returning board,
rejected, on the ground of intimidation of negro voters,
eleven thousand votes that had been cast in due form for
Tilden. In the seventh volume of my history I have told
the story of the compromise in the form of the Electoral
Commission which passed on the conflicting claims and adjudged
the votes of the disputed states, notably Florida
and Louisiana, to Hayes, giving him a majority of one in
the electoral college, thus making him President. When
the count was completed and the usual declaration made,
Hayes had no choice but to abide by the decision. Duty
to his country and to his party, the Republican, required
his acceptance of the office, and there is no reason for thinking
that he had any doubts regarding his proper course.
His legal title was perfect, but his moral title was unsound,
and it added to the difficulty of his situation that the opposition,
the Democrats, had a majority in the House of
<a name="png.254" id="png.254"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">246</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Representatives. None but a determined optimist could have
predicted anything but failure for an administration beginning
under such conditions.</p>

<p>Hayes was an Ohio man, and we in Ohio now watched
his successive steps with keen interest. We knew him as a
man of high character, with a fine sense of honor, but we
placed no great faith in his ability. He had added to his
reputation by the political campaign that he had made for
governor, in 1875, against the Democrats under William
Allen, who demanded an inflation of the greenback currency.
He took an uncompromising stand for sound money, although
that cause was unpopular in Ohio, and he spoke from
the stump unremittingly and fearlessly, although overshadowed
by the greater ability and power of expression of
Senator Sherman and of Carl Schurz, who did yeoman&#8217;s
service for the Republicans in this campaign. Senator
Sherman had suggested Hayes as candidate for President,
and the nomination by the Republican national convention
had come to him in June, 1876. While his letter of acceptance
may not have surprised his intimate friends, it was a
revelation to most of us from its outspoken and common-sense
advocacy of civil service reform, and it gave us the
first glimmering that in Rutherford B. Hayes the Republicans
had for standard bearer a man of more than respectable
ability.</p>

<p>His inaugural address confirmed this impression. He
spoke with dignity and sympathy of the disputed Presidency,
promised a liberal policy toward the Southern states,
and declared that a reform in our civil service was a
&ldquo;paramount necessity.&rdquo; He chose for his Cabinet men in
sympathy with his high ideals. William M. Evarts, the Secretary
of State, was one of the ablest lawyers in the
country. He had been one of the leading counsel in the
<a name="png.255" id="png.255"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">247</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>defense of President Johnson in the impeachment trial,
and had managed the Republican cause before the Electoral
Commission with adroitness and zeal. John Sherman,
the Secretary of the Treasury, was the most capable financier
in public life. Carl Schurz, the Secretary of the Interior,
was an aggressive and uncompromising reformer,
who had served the Republican party well in the campaigns
of 1875 and 1876. If these three men could work together
under Hayes, the United States need envy the governors of
no other country. They were in the brilliant but solid
class, were abreast of the best thought of their time, had a
solemn sense of duty, and believed in righteous government.
Devens, the Attorney-General, had served with credit in the
army and had held the honorable position of Justice of the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Thompson of
Indiana, Secretary of the Navy, was a political appointment
due to the influence of Senator Morton, but, all things
considered, it was not a bad choice. McCrary of Iowa, as
Secretary of War, had been a useful member of the House
of Representatives. The Postmaster-General was Key of
Tennessee, who had served in the Confederate army and
voted for Tilden. This appointment was not so genuine a
recognition of the South as would have been made if Hayes
could have carried out his first intention, which was the appointment
of General Joseph E. Johnston as Secretary of
War. Considering that Johnston had surrendered the second
great army of the Confederacy only twelve years before, the
thought was possible only to a magnanimous nature, and in
the inner circle of Hayes&#8217;s counselors obvious and grave
objections were urged. General Sherman doubted the wisdom
of the proposed appointment, although he said that as
General of the army he would be entirely content to receive
the President&#8217;s orders through his old antagonist. Although
<a name="png.256" id="png.256"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">248</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the appointment of Johnston would have added strength,
the Cabinet as finally made up was strong, and the selection
of such advisers created a favorable impression upon the intelligent
sentiment of the country; it was spoken of as the
ablest Cabinet since Washington&#8217;s.</p>

<p>A wise inaugural address and an able Cabinet made a good
beginning, but before the harmonious coöperation of these
extraordinary men could be developed a weighty question,
which brooked no delay, had to be settled. The Stevens-Sumner
plan of the reconstruction of the South on the basis
of universal negro suffrage and military support of the governments
thus constituted had failed. One by one in
various ways the Southern states had recovered home rule
until, on the inauguration of Hayes, carpet-bag negro governments
existed in only two states, South Carolina and
Louisiana. In both of these the Democrats maintained
that their candidates for governor had been lawfully elected.
The case of South Carolina presented no serious difficulty.
Hayes electors had been rightfully chosen, and so had the
Democratic governor, Hampton. But Chamberlain, the
Republican candidate, had a claim based on the exclusion
of the votes of two counties by the board of state canvassers.
After conferences between each of the claimants and the
President, the question was settled in favor of the Democrat,
which was the meaning of the withdrawal of the United
States troops from the State House in Columbia.</p>

<p>The case of Louisiana was much more troublesome.
Packard, the Republican candidate for governor, had received
as many votes as Hayes, and logic seemed to require
that, if Hayes be President, Packard should be governor.
While the question was pending, Blaine said in the Senate:
&ldquo;You discredit Packard, and you discredit Hayes. You
hold that Packard is not the legal governor of Louisiana,
<a name="png.257" id="png.257"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">249</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and President Hayes has no title.&rdquo; And the other leaders
of the Republican party, for the most part, held this view.
To these and their followers Blaine applied the name &ldquo;Stalwarts,&rdquo;
stiff partisans, who did not believe in surrendering
the hold of the Republicans on the Southern states.</p>

<p>Between the policies of a continuance of the support of
the Republican party in Louisiana or its withdrawal, a weak
man would have allowed things to drift, while a strong man
of the Conkling and Chandler type would have sustained the
Packard government with the whole force at his command.
Hayes acted slowly and cautiously, asked for and received
much good counsel, and in the end determined to withdraw
the United States troops from the immediate vicinity of the
State House in Louisiana. The Packard government fell,
and the Democrats took possession. The lawyers could
furnish cogent reasons why Packard was not entitled to the
governorship, although the electoral vote of Louisiana had
been counted for Hayes; but the Stalwarts maintained
that no legal quibble could varnish over so glaring an inconsistency.
Indeed, it was one of those illogical acts, so
numerous in English and American history, that resolve
difficulties, when a rigid adherence to logic would tend to
foment trouble.</p>

<p>The inaugural address and the distinctively reform Cabinet
did not suit the party workers, and when the President
declined to sustain the Packard government in Louisiana,
disapproval was succeeded by rage. In six weeks after his
inauguration Hayes was without a party; that is to say,
the men who carried on the organization were bitterly opposed
to his policy, and they made much more noise than
the independent thinking voters who believed that a man
had arisen after their own hearts. Except from the Southern
wing, he received little sympathy from the Democratic
<a name="png.258" id="png.258"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">250</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>party. In their parlance, fraud was written on his brow.
He had the honor and perquisites of office which were rightfully
theirs.</p>

<p>Once the troops were withdrawn from South Carolina and
Louisiana, no backward step was possible, and although
Hayes would have liked congressional support and sympathy
for his act, this was not necessary. The next most important
question of his administration related to finance. He
and his Secretary of the Treasury would have been gratified
by an obedient majority in Congress at their back. Presidents
before and after Hayes have made a greater or less
employment of their patronage to secure the passage of
their favorite measures, but Hayes immediately relinquished
that power by taking a decided position for a civil service
based on merit. In a little over a month after the withdrawal
of the troops from the immediate vicinity of the State
House in Louisiana, he announced his policy in a letter to
his Secretary of the Treasury. &ldquo;It is my wish,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;that the collection of the revenues should be free from
partisan control, and organized on a strictly business basis,
with the same guaranties for efficiency and fidelity in the
selection of the chief and subordinate officers that would be
required by a prudent merchant. Party leaders should
have no more influence in appointments than other equally
respectable citizens. No assessments for political purposes
on officers or subordinates should be allowed. No useless
officer or employee should be retained. No officer should
be required or permitted to take part in the management of
political organizations, caucuses, conventions, or election
campaigns.&rdquo; The mandatory parts of this letter he incorporated
in an order to Federal office-holders, adding: &ldquo;This
rule is applicable to every department of the civil service.
It should be understood by every officer of the general
<a name="png.259" id="png.259"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">251</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>government that he is expected to conform his conduct to its
requirements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must be a source of gratification to the alumni and
faculty of Harvard College that its president and governing
boards were, in June, 1877, in the judicious minority, and
recognized their appreciation of Hayes by conferring upon
him its highest honorary degree. Schurz, who had received
his LL.D. the year before, accompanied Hayes to Cambridge,
and, in his Harvard speech at Commencement, gave
his forcible and sympathetic approval of the &ldquo;famous order
of the President,&rdquo; as it had now come to be called.</p>

<p>A liberal and just Southern policy, the beginning of a
genuine reform in the civil service and the resumption of
specie payments, are measures which distinguish and glorify
President Hayes&#8217;s administration, but in July, 1877, public
attention was diverted from all these by a movement which
partook of the nature of a social uprising. The depression
following the panic of 1873 had been widespread and severe.
The slight revival of business resulting from the Centennial
Exposition of 1876 and the consequent large passenger
traffic had been succeeded by a reaction in 1877 that brought
business men to the verge of despair. Failures of merchants
and manufacturers, stoppage of factories, diminished traffic
on the railroads, railroad bankruptcies and receiverships,
threw a multitude of laborers out of employment; and those
fortunate enough to retain their jobs were less steadily employed,
and were subject to reductions in wages.</p>

<p>The state of railroad transportation was deplorable.
The competition of the trunk lines, as the railroads running
from Chicago to the seaboard were called, was sharp, and,
as there was not business enough for all, the cutting of
through freight rates caused such business to be done at an
actual loss, while the through passenger transportation
<a name="png.260" id="png.260"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">252</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>afforded little profit. Any freight agent knew the remedy:
an increase of freight rates by agreement or through a system
of pooling earnings. Agreements were made, but not
honestly kept, and, after a breach of faith, the fight was
renewed with increased fury. As the railroad managers
thought that they could not increase their gross earnings,
they resolved on decreasing their expenses, and somewhat
hastily and jauntily they announced a reduction of ten per
cent in the wages of their employees.</p>

<p>This was resisted. Trouble first began on the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad, where the men not only struck against
the reduction, but prevented other men from taking their
places, and stopped by force the running of trains. The
militia of West Virginia was inadequate to cope with the situation,
and the governor of that state called on the President
for troops, which were sent with a beneficial effect. But
the trouble spread to Maryland, and a conflict in Baltimore
between the militia and rioters in sympathy with the strikers
resulted in a number of killed and wounded. The next day,
Saturday, July 21, a riot in Pittsburg caused the most profound
sensation in the country since the draft riots of the
Civil War. The men on the Pennsylvania and the Pittsburg,
Fort Wayne and Chicago railroads, had struck, and
all freight traffic was arrested. On this day six hundred
and fifty men of the first division of the Pennsylvania national
guard at Philadelphia arrived in Pittsburg, and, in the
attempt to clear the Twenty-eighth Street crossing, they
replied to the missiles thrown at them by the mob with
volleys of musketry, killing instantly sixteen of the rioters
and wounding many.</p>

<p>Here was cause for exasperation, and a furious mob, composed
of strikers, idle factory hands, and miners, tramps,
communists, and outcasts, began its work of vengeance and
<a name="png.261" id="png.261"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">253</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>plunder. Possessed of firearms, through breaking into a
number of gun shops, they attacked the Philadelphia soldiers,
who had withdrawn to the railroad roundhouse, and
a fierce battle ensued. Unable to dislodge the soldiers by
assault, the rioters attempted to roast them out by setting
fire to cars of coke saturated with petroleum and pushing
these down the track against the roundhouse. This eventually
forced the soldiers to leave the building, but, though
pursued by the rioters, they made a good retreat across the
Allegheny River. The mob, completely beyond control,
began the destruction of railroad property. The torch was
applied to two roundhouses, to railroad sheds, shops and
offices, cars and locomotives. Barrels of spirits, taken from
the freight cars, and opened and drunk, made demons of
the men, and the work of plunder and destruction of goods
in transit went on with renewed fury.</p>

<p>That Saturday night Pittsburg witnessed a reign of terror.
On Sunday the rioting and pillage were continued, and in
the afternoon the Union Depot and Railroad Hotel and an
elevator near by were burned. Then as the rioters were
satiated and too drunk to be longer dangerous, the riot
died out: it was not checked. On Monday, through the
action of the authorities, armed companies of law-abiding
citizens, and some faithful companies of the militia, order
was restored. But meanwhile the strike had spread to a
large number of other railroads between the seaboard and
Chicago and St. Louis. Freight traffic was entirely suspended,
and passenger trains were run only on sufferance
of the strikers. Business was paralyzed, and the condition
of disorganization and unrest continued throughout the
month of July. The governors of West Virginia, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, and Illinois called upon the President
for United States troops, which were promptly sent, and in
<a name="png.262" id="png.262"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">254</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Indiana and Missouri they were employed on the demand of
the United States marshals. Where the regular soldiers
appeared order was at once restored without bloodshed, and
it was said that the rioters feared one Federal bayonet more
than a whole company of militia. The gravity of the situation
is attested by three proclamations of warning from
President Hayes.</p>

<p>Strikes had been common in our country, and, while
serious enough in certain localities, had aroused no general
concern, but the action of the mob in Baltimore, Pittsburg,
and Chicago seemed like an attack on society itself, and it
came like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky, startling Americans,
who had hugged the delusion that such social uprisings
belonged to Europe, and had no reason of being in a
great, free republic where all men had an equal chance.
The railroad managers had no idea that they were letting
loose a slumbering giant when their edict of a ten per cent
reduction went forth. It was due to the prompt and efficient
action of the President that order was ultimately restored.
In the profound and earnest thinking and discussion that
went on during the rest of the year, whenever thoughtful
men gathered together, many a grateful word was said of the
quiet, unassuming man in the White House who saw clearly
his duty and never faltered in pursuing it. It was seen that
the Federal government, with a resolute President at its head,
was a tower of strength in the event of a social uprising.</p>

<p>In the reform of the civil service Hayes proceeded from
words to action. He reappointed Thomas L. James as
postmaster of New York City, who had conducted his office
on a thorough business basis, and gave him sympathetic
support. The New York Custom-house had long been a
political machine in which the interests of politicians had
been more considered than those of the public it was
<a name="png.263" id="png.263"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">255</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>supposed to serve. The President began an investigation of
it through an impartial commission, and he and Sherman
came to the conclusion that the renovation desired, in line
with his letter to the Secretary of the Treasury and his
order to the Federal officers, could not be effected so long
as the present collector, Chester A. Arthur, and the naval
officer, A.&nbsp;B. Cornell, remained in office. Courteous intimations
were sent to them that their resignations were desired
on the ground that new officers could better carry out
the reform which the President had at heart. Arthur and
Cornell, under the influence of Senator Conkling, refused to
resign, and a plain issue was made between the President
and the New York senator. At the special session of Congress,
in October, 1877, he sent to the Senate nominations
of new men for these places, but the power of Conkling,
working through the &ldquo;courtesy of the Senate,&rdquo; was sufficient
to procure their rejection; and this was also the
result when the same nominations were made in December.</p>

<p>In July, 1878, after the adjournment of Congress, Hayes
removed Arthur and Cornell, and appointed Merritt and
Burt in their places. During the following December these
appointments came before the Senate for confirmation.
Sherman decided to resign if they were rejected, and he
made a strong personal appeal to Senators Allison, Windom,
and Morrill that they should not permit &ldquo;the insane hate of
Conkling&rdquo; to override the good of the service and the party.
A seven hours&#8217; struggle ensued in the Senate, but Merritt
and Burt were confirmed by a decisive majority. After
the confirmation, Hayes wrote to Merritt: &ldquo;My desire is
that the office be conducted on strictly business principles
and according to the rules for the civil service which were
recommended by the Civil Service Commission in the administration
of General Grant.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.264" id="png.264"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">256</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>In three of his annual messages, Hayes presented strong
arguments for a reform in the civil service, and he begged
Congress, without avail, to make appropriations to sustain
the Civil Service Commission. He sympathized with and
supported Schurz in his introduction into the Interior Department
of competitive examinations for appointments
and promotions, and he himself extended that system to the
custom-houses and post-offices of the larger cities.</p>

<p>All that was accomplished in this direction was due to his
efforts and those of his Cabinet. He received neither sympathy
nor help from Congress; indeed, he met with great
opposition from his own party. A picture not without
humor is Hayes reading, as his justification, to the Republican
remonstrants against his policy of appointments the
strong declaration for a civil service based on merit in the
Republican platform, on which he had stood as candidate
for President. Though his preaching did not secure the
needed legislation from Congress, it produced a marked
effect on public sentiment.</p>

<p>The organization of civil service reform associations began
under Hayes. The New York association was begun in
1877, reorganized three years later, and soon had a large
national membership, which induced the formation of other
state associations; and although the national civil service
reform league was not formed until after his term of office
expired, the origin of the society may be safely referred to
his influence. In the melioration of the public service
which has been so conspicuously in operation since 1877,
Hayes must be rated the pioneer President. Some of
Grant&#8217;s efforts in this direction were well meant, but he had
no fundamental appreciation of the importance of the question
or enthusiasm for the work, and, in a general way, it
may be said that he left the civil service in a demoralized
<a name="png.265" id="png.265"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">257</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>condition. How pregnant was Hayes&#8217;s remark in his last
annual message, and what a text it has been for many homilies!
&ldquo;My views,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;concerning the dangers of
patronage or appointments for personal or partisan considerations
have been strengthened by my observation and
experience in the executive office, and I believe these dangers
threaten the stability of the government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brightest page in the history of the Republican party
since the Civil War tells of its work in the cause of sound
finance, and no administration is more noteworthy than
that of Hayes. Here again the work was done by the President
and his Cabinet in the face of a determined opposition
in Congress. During the first two years of his administration,
the Democrats had a majority in the House, and during
the last two a majority in both the House and the Senate.
The Republican party was sounder than the Democratic on
the resumption of specie payments and in the advocacy of a
correct money standard, but Hayes had by no means all of
his own party at his back. Enough Republicans, however,
were of his way of thinking to prevent an irremediable
inflation of either greenbacks or silver.</p>

<p>The credit for what was accomplished in finance belongs
in the main to John Sherman, a great financier and consummate
statesman; but he had the constant sympathy and
support of the President. It was their custom to take long
drives together every Sunday afternoon and discuss systematically
and thoroughly the affairs of the Treasury and the
official functions of the President. No President ever had
a better counselor than Sherman, no Secretary of the Treasury
more sympathetic and earnest support than was given
by Hayes. Sherman refunded 845 millions of the public
debt at a lower rate of interest, showing in his negotiations
with bankers a remarkable combination of business and
<a name="png.266" id="png.266"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">258</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>political ability. Cool, watchful, and confident, he grasped
the point of view of New York and London financial syndicates,
and to that interested and somewhat narrow vision
he joined the intelligence and foresight of a statesman.
Sherman brought about the resumption of specie payments
on the 1st of January, 1879, the date fixed in the bill of which
he was the chief author and which, four years before, he had
carried through the Senate. It was once the fashion of his
opponents to discredit his work, and, emphasizing the large
crop of 1878 and the European demand for our breadstuffs,
to declare that resumption was brought about by Providence
and not by John Sherman. No historian of American
finance can fail to see how important is the part often played
by bountiful nature, but it is to the lasting merit of Sherman
and Hayes that, in the dark years of 1877 and 1878,
with cool heads and unshaken faith, they kept the country
in the path of financial safety and honor despite bitter opposition
and clamorous abuse.</p>

<p>These two years formed a part of my own business career,
and I can add my vivid recollection to my present study of
the period. As values steadily declined and losses rather
than profits in business became the rule, the depression
and even despair of business men and manufacturers can
hardly be exaggerated. The daily list of failures and bankruptcies
was appalling. How often one heard that iron
and coal and land were worth too little and money too much,
that only the bondholder could be happy, for his interest
was sure and the purchasing power of his money great!
In August, 1878, when John Sherman went to Toledo to
speak to a gathering three thousand strong, he was
greeted with such cries as, &ldquo;You are responsible for all
the failures in the country&rdquo;; &ldquo;You work to the interest
of the capitalist&rdquo;; &ldquo;Capitalists own you, John Sherman,
<a name="png.267" id="png.267"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">259</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and you rob the poor widows and orphans to make
them rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By many the resumption of specie payments was deemed
impossible. The most charitable of Sherman&#8217;s opponents
looked upon him as an honest but visionary enthusiast who
would fail in his policy and be &ldquo;the deadest man politically&rdquo;
in the country. Others deemed resumption possible only
by driving to the wall a majority of active business men.
It was this sentiment which gave strength to the majority
in the House of Representatives, which was opposed to any
contraction of the greenback currency and in favor of the
free coinage of silver, and of making it likewise a full legal
tender. Most of these members of Congress were sincere,
and thought that they were asking no more than justice
for the trader, the manufacturer, and the laborer. The
&ldquo;Ohio idea&rdquo; was originally associated with an inflation of
the paper currency, but by extension it came to mean an
abundance of cheap money, whether paper or silver. Proposed
legislation, with this as its aim, was very popular in
Ohio, but, despite the intense feeling against the President&#8217;s
and Secretary&#8217;s policy in their own state and generally
throughout the West, Hayes and Sherman maintained it
consistently, and finally brought about the resumption of
specie payments.</p>

<p>In their way of meeting the insistent demand for the
remonetization of silver Hayes and Sherman differed. In
November, 1877, the House of Representatives, under a
suspension of the rules, passed by a vote of 163 to 34 a bill
for the free coinage of the 412½ grain silver dollar, making
that dollar likewise a legal tender for all debts and dues.
The Senate was still Republican, but the Republican senators
were by no means unanimous for the gold standard.
Sherman became convinced that, although the free-silver
<a name="png.268" id="png.268"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">260</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>bill could not pass the Senate, something must nevertheless
be done for silver, and, in coöperation with Senator Allison,
he was instrumental in the adoption of the compromise
which finally became law. This remonetized silver, providing
for the purchase of not less than two million dollars&#8217; worth
of silver bullion per month, nor more than four millions,
and for its coinage into 412½ grain silver dollars. Hayes
vetoed this bill, sending a sound and manly message to the
House of Representatives; but Congress passed it over his
veto by a decided majority.</p>

<p>The regard for John Sherman&#8217;s ability in Ohio was unbounded,
and it was generally supposed that in all financial
affairs, as well as in many others, he dominated Hayes. I
shared that opinion until I learned indirectly from John
Hay, who was first assistant Secretary of State and intimate
in inner administration circles, that this was not true; that
Hayes had decided opinions of his own and did not hesitate
to differ with his Secretary of the Treasury. Nevertheless,
not until John Sherman&#8217;s &ldquo;Recollections&rdquo; were published
was it generally known, I believe, that Sherman had a share
in the Allison compromise, and did not approve of the President&#8217;s
veto of the bill remonetizing silver.</p>

<p>The Federal control of congressional and presidential
elections, being a part of the Reconstruction legislation,
was obnoxious to the Democrats, and they attempted to
abrogate it by &ldquo;riders&rdquo; attached to several appropriation
bills, especially that providing for the army. While the
Senate remained Republican, there was chance for an accommodation
between the President and the Senate on one
side and the House on the other. Two useful compromises
were made, the Democrats yielding in one case, the Republicans
in the other. But in 1879, when both the House and
the Senate were Democratic, a sharp contest began between
<a name="png.269" id="png.269"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">261</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Congress and the executive, the history of which is written
in seven veto messages. For lack of appropriations to
carry on the government, the President called an extra
session of Congress in the first year of his administration and
another in 1879, which was a remarkable record of extra
sessions in a time of peace. The Democratic House passed
a resolution for the appointment of a committee to investigate
Hayes&#8217;s title and aroused some alarm lest an effort
might be made &ldquo;to oust President Hayes and inaugurate
Tilden.&rdquo; Although this alarm was stilled less than a month
later by a decisive vote of the House, the action and investigation
were somewhat disquieting.</p>

<p>Thus Hayes encountered sharp opposition from the Democrats,
who frequently pointed their arguments by declaring
that he held his place by means of fraud. He received
sympathy from hardly any of the leaders of his own party
in Congress, and met with open condemnation from the
Stalwarts; yet he pursued his course with steadiness and
equanimity, and was happy in his office. His serene amiability
and hopefulness, especially in regard to affairs in
the Southern states, were a source of irritation to the Stalwarts;
but it was the serenity of a man who felt himself
fully equal to his responsibilities.</p>

<p>In his inaugural address, Hayes contributed an addition
to our political idiom, &ldquo;He serves his party best who
serves the country best.&rdquo; His administration was a striking
illustration of this maxim. When he became President, the
Republican party was in a demoralized condition, but, despite
the factional criticism to which he was subject, he
gained in the first few months of his Presidency the approval
of men of intelligence and independent thought, and, as
success attended his different policies, he received the support
of the masses. The signal Republican triumph in
<a name="png.270" id="png.270"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">262</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the presidential election of 1880 was due to the improvement
in business conditions and to the clean and efficient
administration of Hayes.</p>

<p>In recalling his predecessor in office, we think more gladly
of the Grant of Donelson, Vicksburg, and Appomattox
than of Grant the President, for during his two administrations
corruption was rife and bad government to the fore.
Financial scandals were so frequent that despairing patriots
cried out, &ldquo;Is there no longer honesty in public life?&rdquo; Our
country then reached the high-water mark of corruption in
national affairs. A striking improvement began under
Hayes, who infused into the public service his own high
ideals of honesty and efficiency. Hayes was much assisted
in his social duties by his wife, a woman of character and
intelligence, who carried herself with grace and dignity.
One sometimes heard the remark that as Hayes was ruled in
political matters by John Sherman, so in social affairs he
was ruled by his wife. The sole foundation for this lay in
his deference to her total abstinence principles, which she
held so strongly as to exclude wine from the White House
table except, I believe, at one official dinner, that to the
Russian Grand Dukes.</p>

<p>Hayes&#8217;s able Cabinet was likewise a harmonious one.
Its members were accustomed to dine together at regular
intervals (fortnightly, I think), when affairs of state and
other subjects were discussed, and the geniality of these
occasions was enhanced by a temperate circulation of the
wine bottle. There must have been very good talk at these
social meetings. Evarts and Schurz were citizens of the
world. Evarts was a man of keen intelligence and wide
information, and possessed a genial as well as a caustic
wit. Schurz could discuss present politics and past history.
He was well versed in European history of the eighteenth
<a name="png.271" id="png.271"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">263</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>century and the Napoleonic wars, and could talk about the
power of Voltaire in literature and the influence of
Lessing on Goethe. From appreciative discourse on the
Wagner opera and the French drama, he could, if the conversation
turned to the Civil War, give a lively account of
the battles of Chancellorsville or Gettysburg, in both of
which he had borne an honorable part. Sherman was not
a cosmopolitan like his two colleagues, but he loved dining
out. His manners were those of the old-school gentleman;
he could listen with genial appreciation, and he could talk
of events in American history of which he had been a contemporaneous
observer; as, for example, of the impressive
oratory of Daniel Webster at a dinner in Plymouth; or the
difference between the national conventions of his early
political life and the huge ones of the present, illustrating
his comparison with an account of the Whig convention of
1852, to which he went as a delegate.</p>

<p>Differing in many respects, Hayes and Grover Cleveland
were alike in the possession of executive ability and the lack
of oratorical. We all know that it is a purely academic
question which is the better form of government, the English
or our own, as both have grown up to adapt themselves
to peculiar conditions. But when I hear an enthusiast for
Cabinet government and ministerial responsibility, I like to
point out that men like Hayes and Cleveland, who made
excellent Presidents, could never have been prime ministers.
One cannot conceive of either in an office equivalent to that
of First Lord of the Treasury, being heckled by members
on the front opposition bench and holding his own or getting
the better of his opponents.</p>

<p>I have brought Hayes and Cleveland into juxtaposition,
as each had a high personal regard for the other. Hayes
died on January 17, 1893. Cleveland, the President-elect,
<a name="png.272" id="png.272"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">264</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was to be inaugurated on the following fourth of March.
Despite remonstrance and criticism from bitter partisans
of his own party, who deprecated any honor paid to one
whom all good Democrats deemed a fraudulent President,
Cleveland traveled from New York to Fremont, Ohio, to
attend the funeral. He could only think of Hayes as an
ex-President and a man whom he highly esteemed.</p>

 /></span>EDWIN LAWRENCE GODKIN</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> two great journalists of the nineteenth century were
Greeley and Godkin. Though differing in very many
respects, they were alike in possessing a definite moral purpose.
The most glorious and influential portion of Greeley&#8217;s
career lay between the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act
in 1854 and the election of Lincoln in 1860, when the press
played an important part in the upbuilding of a political
party which formulated in a practical manner the antislavery
sentiment of the country. Foremost among newspapers
was the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>; foremost among editors
was Horace Greeley. Of Greeley in his best days Godkin
wrote: &ldquo;He has an enthusiasm which never flags, and a
faith in principles which nothing can shake, and an English
style which, for vigor, terseness, clearness, and simplicity,
has never been surpassed, except perhaps by Cobbett.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.1"
 name="fna.xvi.1" id="fna.xvi.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Greeley and Godkin were alike in furnishing their readers
with telling arguments. In northern New York and the
Western Reserve of Ohio the <cite>Weekly Tribune</cite> was a political
Bible. &ldquo;Why do you look so gloomy?&rdquo; said a traveler,
riding along the highway in the Western Reserve during
the old antislavery days, to a farmer who was sitting
moodily on a fence. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the farmer, &ldquo;my
Democratic friend next door got the best of me in an argument
last night. But when I get my <cite>Weekly Tribune</cite> to-morrow
I&#8217;ll knock the foundations all out from under him.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.2"
 name="fna.xvi.2" id="fna.xvi.2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Premising that Godkin is as closely identified with <cite>The
<a name="png.276" id="png.276"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">268</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Nation</cite> and the <cite>Evening Post</cite> as Greeley with the <cite>Tribune</cite>, I
shall refer to a personal experience. Passing a part of the
winter of 1886 in a hotel at Thomasville, Georgia, it chanced
that among the hundred or more guests there were eight
or ten of us who regularly received <cite>The Nation</cite> by post.
Ordinarily it arrived on the Friday noon train from Savannah,
and when we came from our mid-day dinner into the
hotel office, there, in our respective boxes, easily seen, and
from their peculiar form recognized by every one, were our
copies of <cite>The Nation</cite>. Occasionally the papers missed connection
at Savannah, and our <cite>Nations</cite> did not arrive until
after supper. It used to be said by certain scoffers that if a
discussion of political questions came up in the afternoon of
one of those days of disappointment, we readers were mum;
but in the late evening, after having digested our political
pabulum, we were ready to join issue with any antagonist.
Indeed, each of us might have used the words of James
Russell Lowell, written while he was traveling on the Continent
and visiting many places where <cite>The Nation</cite> could not
be bought: &ldquo;All the time I was without it, my mind was
chaos and I didn&#8217;t feel that I had a safe opinion to swear
by.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.3"
 name="fna.xvi.3" id="fna.xvi.3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>While the farmer of the Western Reserve and Lowell
are extreme types of clientèle, each represents fairly well
the peculiar following of Greeley and of Godkin, which
differed as much as did the personal traits of the two journalists.
Godkin speaks of Greeley&#8217;s &ldquo;odd attire, shambling
gait, simple, good-natured and hopelessly peaceable
face, and long yellow locks.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.4"
 name="fna.xvi.4" id="fna.xvi.4">4</a></sup> His &ldquo;old white hat and
white coat,&rdquo; which in New York were regarded as an affectation,
counted with his following west of the Hudson River
as a winning eccentricity. When he came out upon the
<a name="png.277" id="png.277"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">269</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>lecture platform with crumpled shirt, cravat awry, and
wrinkled coat looking as if he had traveled for a number of
nights and days, such disorder appeared to many of his
Western audiences as nothing worse than the mark of a very
busy man, who had paid them the compliment of leaving
his editorial rooms to speak to them in person, and who had
their full sympathy as he thus opened his discourse, &ldquo;You
mustn&#8217;t, my friends, expect fine words from a rough busy
man like me.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.5"
 name="fna.xvi.5" id="fna.xvi.5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The people who read the <cite>Tribune</cite> did not expect fine
words; they were used to the coarse, abusive language in
which Greeley repelled attacks, and to his giving the lie
with heartiness and vehemence. They enjoyed reading
that &ldquo;another lie was nailed to the counter,&rdquo; and that an
antagonist &ldquo;was a liar, knowing himself to be a liar, and
lying with naked intent to deceive.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.6"
 name="fna.xvi.6" id="fna.xvi.6">6</a></sup></p>

<p>On the contrary, the dress, the face, and the personal
bearing of Godkin proclaimed at once the gentleman and
cultivated man of the world. You felt that he was a man
whom you would like to meet at dinner, accompany on a
long walk, or cross the Atlantic with, were you an acquaintance
or friend.</p>

<p>An incident related by Godkin himself shows that at
least one distinguished gentleman did not enjoy sitting at
meat with Greeley. During the spring of 1864 Godkin met
Greeley at breakfast at the house of Mr. John A.&nbsp;C. Gray.
William Cullen Bryant, at that time editor of the New York
<cite>Evening Post</cite>, was one of the guests, and, when Greeley entered
the room, was standing near the fireplace conversing
with his host. On observing that Bryant did not speak to
Greeley, Gray asked him in a whisper, &ldquo;Don&#8217;t you know
<a name="png.278" id="png.278"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">270</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Mr. Greeley?&rdquo; In a loud whisper Bryant replied, &ldquo;No, I
don&#8217;t; he&#8217;s a blackguard&mdash;he&#8217;s a blackguard.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.7"
 name="fna.xvi.7" id="fna.xvi.7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>In the numbers of people whom he influenced, Greeley
had the advantage over Godkin. In February, 1855, the
circulation of the <cite>Tribune</cite> was 172,000, and its own estimate
of its readers half a million, which was certainly not excessive.
It is not a consideration beyond bounds to infer that
the readers of the <cite>Tribune</cite> in 1860 furnished a goodly part
of the <ins class="TNsilent" title="Transcriber's note:
 original has 1,886,000">1,866,000</ins> votes which were received by Lincoln.</p>

<p>At different times, while Godkin was editor, <cite>The Nation</cite>
stated its exact circulation, which, as I remember it, was
about 10,000, and it probably had 50,000 readers. As many
of its readers were in the class of Lowell, its indirect influence
was immense. Emerson said that <cite>The Nation</cite> had &ldquo;breadth,
variety, self-sustainment, and an admirable style of thought
and expression.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I owe much to <cite>The Nation</cite>,&rdquo; wrote
Francis Parkman. &ldquo;I regard it as the most valuable of
American journals, and feel that the best interests of the
country are doubly involved in its success.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What an
influence you have!&rdquo; said George William Curtis to Godkin.
&ldquo;What a sanitary element in our affairs <cite>The Nation</cite>
 is!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To
my generation,&rdquo; wrote William James, &ldquo;Godkin&#8217;s was
certainly the towering influence in all thought concerning
public affairs, and indirectly his influence has certainly
been more pervasive than that of any other writer of the
generation, for he influenced other writers who never quoted
him, and determined the whole current of discussion.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;When
the work of this century is summed up,&rdquo; wrote
Charles Eliot Norton to Godkin, &ldquo;what you have done for
the good old cause of civilization, the cause which is always
defeated, but always after defeat taking more advanced position
than before&mdash;what you have done for this cause will
<a name="png.279" id="png.279"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">271</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>count for much.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am conscious,&rdquo; wrote President
Eliot to Godkin, &ldquo;that <cite>The Nation</cite> has had a decided effect
on my opinions and my action for nearly forty years; and
I believe it has had like effect on thousands of educated
Americans.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.8"
 name="fna.xvi.8" id="fna.xvi.8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>A string of quotations, as is well known, becomes wearisome;
but the importance of the point that I am trying to
make will probably justify one more. &ldquo;I find myself so
thoroughly agreeing with <cite>The Nation</cite> always,&rdquo; wrote Lowell,
&ldquo;that I am half persuaded that I edit it myself!&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.9"
 name="fna.xvi.9" id="fna.xvi.9">9</a></sup> Truly
Lowell had a good company: Emerson, Parkman, Curtis,
Norton, James, Eliot,&mdash;all teachers in various ways.
Through their lectures, books, and speeches, they influenced
college students at an impressible age; they appealed to
young and to middle-aged men; and they furnished comfort
and entertainment for the old. It would have been difficult
to find anywhere in the country an educated man whose
thought was not affected by some one of these seven; and
their influence on editorial writers for newspapers was remarkable.
These seven were all taught by Godkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every Friday morning when <cite>The Nation</cite> comes,&rdquo; wrote
Lowell to Godkin, &ldquo;I fill my pipe, and read it from beginning
to end. Do you do it all yourself? Or are there really so
many clever men in the country?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.10"
 name="fna.xvi.10" id="fna.xvi.10">10</a></sup> Lowell&#8217;s experience,
with or without tobacco, was undoubtedly that of hundreds,
perhaps of thousands, of educated men, and the query he
raised was not an uncommon one. At one time, Godkin, I
believe, wrote most of &ldquo;The Week,&rdquo; which was made up
of brief and pungent comments on events, as well as the principal
editorial articles. The power of iteration, which the
journalist possesses, is great, and, when that power is wielded
<a name="png.280" id="png.280"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">272</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>by a man of keen intelligence and wide information, possessing
a knowledge of the world, a sense of humor, and an effective
literary style, it becomes tremendous. The only escape
from Godkin&#8217;s iteration was one frequently tried, and that
was, to stop <cite>The Nation</cite>.</p>

<p>Although Godkin published three volumes of Essays, the
honors he received during his lifetime were due to his work
as editor of <cite>The Nation</cite> and the <cite>Evening Post</cite>; and this is
his chief title of fame. The education, early experience,
and aspiration of such a journalist are naturally matter of
interest. Born in 1831, in the County of Wicklow in the
southeastern part of Ireland, the son of a Presbyterian minister,
he was able to say when referring to Goldwin Smith,
&ldquo;I am an Irishman, but I am as English in blood as he is.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.11"
 name="fna.xvi.11" id="fna.xvi.11">11</a></sup>
Receiving his higher education at Queen&#8217;s College, Belfast,
he took a lively interest in present politics, his college friends
being Liberals. John Stuart Mill was their prophet, Grote
and Bentham their daily companions, and America was their
promised land. &ldquo;To the scoffs of the Tories that our
schemes were impracticable,&rdquo; he has written of these days,
&ldquo;our answer was that in America, barring slavery, they were
actually at work. There, the chief of the state and the legislators
were freely elected by the people. There, the offices
were open to everybody who had the capacity to fill them.
There was no army or navy, two great curses of humanity
in all ages. There was to be no war except war in self-defense&hellip;. In
fact, we did not doubt that in America
at last the triumph of humanity over its own weaknesses
and superstitions was being achieved, and the dream of
Christendom was at last being realized.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.12"
 name="fna.xvi.12" id="fna.xvi.12">12</a></sup></p>

<p>As a correspondent of the London <cite>Daily News</cite> he went to
the Crimea. The scenes at Malakoff gave him a disgust for
<a name="png.281" id="png.281"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">273</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>war which thenceforth he never failed to express upon every
opportunity. When a man of sixty-eight, reckoning its
cost in blood and treasure, he deemed the Crimean War
entirely unnecessary and very deplorable.<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.13"
 name="fna.xvi.13" id="fna.xvi.13">13</a></sup> Godkin arrived
in America in November, 1856, and soon afterwards, with
Olmsted&#8217;s &ldquo;Journey in the Seaboard Slave States,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Back
Country,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Texas,&rdquo; as guidebooks, took a horseback journey
through the South. Following closely Olmsted&#8217;s trail,
and speaking therefore with knowledge, he has paid him one
of the highest compliments one traveler ever paid another.
&ldquo;Olmsted&#8217;s work,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;in vividness of description
and in photographic minuteness far surpasses Arthur
Young&#8217;s.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.14"
 name="fna.xvi.14" id="fna.xvi.14">14</a></sup> During this journey he wrote letters to the
London <cite>Daily News</cite>, and these were continued after his
return to New York City. For the last three years of our
Civil War, he was its regular correspondent, and, as no one
denies that he was a powerful advocate when his heart was
enlisted, he rendered efficient service to the cause of the
North. The <cite>News</cite> was strongly pro-Northern, and Godkin
furnished the facts which rendered its leaders sound and
instructive as well as sympathetic. All this while he was
seeing socially the best people in New York City, and making
useful and desirable acquaintances in Boston and Cambridge.</p>

<p>The interesting story of the foundation of <cite>The Nation</cite> has
been told a number of times, and it will suffice for our purpose
to say that there were forty stockholders who contributed
a capital of one hundred thousand dollars, one half
of which was raised in Boston, and one quarter each in
Philadelphia and New York. Godkin was the editor, and
next to him the chief promoters were James M. McKim of
Philadelphia and Charles Eliot Norton. The first number
<a name="png.282" id="png.282"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">274</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of this &ldquo;weekly journal of politics, literature, science, and
art&rdquo; appeared on July 6, 1865. Financial embarrassment
and disagreements among the stockholders marked the first
year of its existence, at the end of which Godkin, McKim,
and Frederick Law Olmsted took over the property, and
continued the publication under the proprietorship of E.&nbsp;L.
Godkin &amp;&nbsp;Co. &ldquo;<cite>The Nation</cite> owed its continued existence to
Charles Eliot Norton,&rdquo; wrote Godkin in 1899. &ldquo;It was his
calm and confidence amid the shrieks of combatants &hellip; which
enabled me to do my work even with decency.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.15"
 name="fna.xvi.15" id="fna.xvi.15">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Sixteen years after <cite>The Nation</cite> was started, in 1881, Godkin
sold it out to the <cite>Evening Post</cite>, becoming associate editor
of that journal, with Carl Schurz as his chief. <cite>The Nation</cite>
was thereafter published as the weekly edition of the <cite>Evening
Post</cite>. In 1883 Schurz retired and Godkin was made
editor-in-chief, having the aid and support of one of the
owners, Horace White. On January 1, 1900, on account of
ill health, he withdrew from the editorship of the <cite>Evening
Post</cite>,<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.16"
 name="fna.xvi.16" id="fna.xvi.16">16</a></sup> thus retiring from active journalism.</p>

<p>For thirty-five years he had devoted himself to his
work with extraordinary ability and singleness of purpose.
Marked appreciation came to him: invitations to deliver
courses of lectures from both Harvard and Yale, the degree
of A.M. from Harvard, and the degree of D.C.L. from
Oxford. What might have been a turning point in his
career was the offer in 1870 of the professorship of history at
Harvard. He was strongly tempted to accept it, but, before
coming to a decision, he took counsel of a number of
friends; and few men, I think, have ever received such
wise and disinterested advice as did Godkin when he was
thus hesitating in what way he should apply his teaching.
<a name="png.283" id="png.283"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">275</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>The burden of the advice was not to take the professorship,
if he had to give up <cite>The Nation</cite>.</p>

<p>Frederick Law Olmsted wrote to him: &ldquo;If you can&#8217;t
write fully half of &lsquo;The Week&rsquo; and half the leaders, and
control the drift and tone of the whole while living at Cambridge,
give up the professorship, for <cite>The Nation</cite> is worth
many professorships. It is a question of loyalty over a
question of comfort.&rdquo; Lowell wrote to him in the same
strain: &ldquo;<em>Stay</em> if the two things are incompatible. We
may find another professor by and by &hellip; but we can&#8217;t find
another editor for <cite>The Nation</cite>.&rdquo; From Germany, John
Bigelow sent a characteristic message: &ldquo;Tell the University
to require each student to take a copy of <cite>The Nation</cite>. Do
not profess history for them in any other way. I dare say
your lectures would be good, but why limit your pupils to
hundreds which are now counted by thousands?&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.17"
 name="fna.xvi.17" id="fna.xvi.17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>As is well known, Godkin relinquished the idea of the
college connection and stuck to his job, although the quiet
and serenity of a professor&#8217;s life in Cambridge contrasted
with his own turbulent days appealed to him powerfully.
&ldquo;Ten years hence,&rdquo; he wrote to Norton, &ldquo;if things go on as
they are now I shall be the most odious man in America.
Not that I shall not have plenty of friends, but my enemies
will be far more numerous and active.&rdquo; Six years after he
had founded <cite>The Nation</cite>, and one year after he had declined
the Harvard professorship, when he was yet but forty years
old, he gave this humorously exaggerated account of his
physical failings due to his nervous strain: &ldquo;I began <cite>The
Nation</cite> young, handsome, and fascinating, and am now
withered and somewhat broken, rheumatism gaining on me
rapidly, my complexion ruined, as also my figure, for I
am growing stout.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.18"
 name="fna.xvi.18" id="fna.xvi.18">18</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="png.284" id="png.284"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">276</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But his choice between the Harvard professorship and
<cite>The Nation</cite> was a wise one. He was a born writer of paragraphs
and editorials. The files of <cite>The Nation</cite> are his monument.
A crown of his laborious days is the tribute of James
Bryce: &ldquo;<cite>The Nation</cite> was the best weekly not only in America
but in the world.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.19"
 name="fna.xvi.19" id="fna.xvi.19">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Thirty-five years of journalism, in which Godkin was accustomed
to give hard blows, did not, as he himself foreshadowed,
call forth a unanimous chorus of praise; and the
objections of intelligent and high-minded men are well
worth taking into account. The most common one is that
his criticism was always destructive; that he had an eye
for the weak side of causes and men that he did not favor,
and these he set forth with unremitting vigor without regard
for palliating circumstances; that he erected a high
and impossible ideal and judged all men by it; hence, if a
public man was right eight times out of ten, he would seize
upon the two failures and so parade them with his withering
sarcasm that the reader could get no other idea than that
the man was either weak or wicked. An editor of very
positive opinions, he was apt to convey the idea that if any
one differed from him on a vital question, like the tariff or
finance or civil service reform, he was necessarily a bad man.
He made no allowances for the weaknesses of human nature,
and had no idea that he himself ever could be mistaken.
Though a powerful critic, he did not realize the highest
criticism, which discerns and brings out the good as well as
the evil. He won his reputation by dealing out censure,
which has a rare attraction for a certain class of minds,
as Tacitus observed in his &ldquo;History.&rdquo; &ldquo;People,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;lend a ready ear to detraction and spite,&rdquo; for &ldquo;malignity
wears the imposing appearance of independence.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.20"
 name="fna.xvi.20" id="fna.xvi.20">20</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="png.285" id="png.285"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">277</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The influence of <cite>The Nation</cite>, therefore,&mdash;so these objectors
to Godkin aver,&mdash;was especially unfortunate on
the intelligent youth of the country. It was in 1870 that
John Bigelow, whom I have just quoted, advised Harvard
University to include <cite>The Nation</cite> among its requirements;
and it is true that at that time, and for a good while afterwards,
<cite>The Nation</cite> was favorite reading for serious Harvard
students. The same practice undoubtedly prevailed at
most other colleges. Now I have been told that the effect
of reading <cite>The Nation</cite> was to prevent these young men from
understanding their own country; that, as Godkin himself
did not comprehend America, he was an unsound teacher
and made his youthful readers see her through a false medium.
And I am further informed that in mature life it cost
an effort, a mental wrench, so to speak, to get rid of this influence
and see things as they really were, which was necessary
for usefulness in lives cast in America. The United
States was our country; she was entitled to our love and
service; and yet such a frame of mind was impossible, so
this objection runs, if we read and believed the writing of
<cite>The Nation</cite>. A man of character and ability, who had filled
a number of public offices with credit, told me that the influence
of <cite>The Nation</cite> had been potent in keeping college
graduates out of public life; that things in the United States
were painted so black both relatively and absolutely that
the young men naturally reasoned, &ldquo;Why shall we concern
ourselves about a country which is surely going to destruction?&rdquo;
Far better, they may have said, to pattern after
Plato&#8217;s philosopher who kept out of politics, being &ldquo;like
one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of
dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.21"
 name="fna.xvi.21" id="fna.xvi.21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Such considerations undoubtedly lost <cite>The Nation</cite> valuable
<a name="png.286" id="png.286"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">278</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>subscribers. I have been struck with three circumstances
in juxtaposition. At the time of Judge Hoar&#8217;s forced resignation
from Grant&#8217;s Cabinet in 1870, <cite>The Nation</cite> said, &ldquo;In
peace as in war &lsquo;that is best blood which hath most iron in&#8217;t;&rsquo;
and much is to be excused to the man [that is, Judge Hoar]
who has for the first time in many years of Washington
history given a back-handed blow to many an impudent
and arrogant dispenser of patronage. He may well be
proud of most of the enmity that he won while in office,
and may go back contented to Massachusetts to be her most
honored citizen.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.22"
 name="fna.xvi.22" id="fna.xvi.22">22</a></sup> Two months later Lowell wrote to
Godkin, &ldquo;The bound volumes of <cite>The Nation</cite> standing on
Judge Hoar&#8217;s library table, as I saw them the other day,
were a sign of the estimation in which it is held by solid people
and it is they who in the long run decide the fortunes of
such a journal.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.23"
 name="fna.xvi.23" id="fna.xvi.23">23</a></sup> But <cite>The Nation</cite> lost Judge Hoar&#8217;s support.
When I called upon him in 1893 he was no longer
taking or reading it.</p>

<p>It is the sum of individual experiences that makes up
the influence of a journal like <cite>The Nation</cite>, and one may therefore
be pardoned the egotism necessarily arising from a relation
of one&#8217;s own contact with it. In 1866, while a student
at the University of Chicago, I remember well that, in a
desultory talk in the English Literature class, Professor
William Matthews spoke of <cite>The Nation</cite> and advised the
students to read it each week as a political education of
high value. This was the first knowledge I had of it, but
I was at that time, along with many other young men, devoted
to the <cite>Round Table</cite>, an &ldquo;Independent weekly review
of Politics, Finance, Literature, Society, and Art,&rdquo; which
flourished between the years 1864 and 1868. We asked the
professor, &ldquo;Do you consider <cite>The Nation</cite> superior to the
<a name="png.287" id="png.287"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">279</span><span class="ns">]
 </span><cite>Round Table</cite>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;The editors
of the <cite>Round Table</cite> seem to write for the sake of writing,
while the men who are expressing themselves in <cite>The
Nation</cite> do so because their hearts and minds are full of their
matter.&rdquo; This was a just estimate of the difference between
the two journals. The <cite>Round Table</cite>, modeled after the
<cite>Saturday Review</cite>, was a feeble imitation of the London
weekly, then in its palmy days, while <cite>The Nation</cite>, which was
patterned after the <cite>Spectator</cite>, did not suffer by the side of its
model. On this hint from Professor Matthews, I began
taking and reading <cite>The Nation</cite>, and with the exception of
one year in Europe during my student days, I have read it
ever since.</p>

<p>Before I touch on certain specifications I must premise
that the influence of this journal on a Westerner, who read
it in a receptive spirit, was probably more potent than on
one living in the East. The arrogance of a higher civilization
in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia than elsewhere
in the United States, the term &ldquo;wild and woolly West,&rdquo;
applied to the region west of the Alleghany Mountains, is
somewhat irritating to a Westerner. Yet it remains none
the less true that, other things being equal, a man living in
the environment of Boston or New York would have arrived
more easily and more quickly at certain sound political
views I shall proceed to specify than he would while living
in Cleveland or Chicago. The gospel which Godkin preached
was needed much more in the West than in the East; and
his disciples in the western country had for him a high degree
of reverence. In the biography of Godkin, allusion is
made to the small pecuniary return for his work, but in
thinking of him we never considered the money question.
We supposed that he made a living; we knew from his articles
that he was a gentleman, and saw much of good society,
<a name="png.288" id="png.288"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">280</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and there was not one of us who would not rather have been
in his shoes than in those of the richest man in New York.
We placed such trust in him&mdash;which his life shows to have
been abundantly justified&mdash;that we should have lost all
confidence in human nature had he ever been tempted by
place or profit. And his influence was abiding. Presidents,
statesmen, senators, congressmen rose and fell; political
administrations changed; good, bad, and weak public men
passed away; but Godkin preached to us every week a timely
and cogent sermon.</p>

<p>To return now to my personal experience. I owe wholly
to <cite>The Nation</cite> my conviction in favor of civil service reform;
in fact, it was from these columns that I first came to understand
the question. The arguments advanced were sane
and strong, and especially intelligible to men in business,
who, in the main, chose their employees on the ground of
fitness, and who made it a rule to retain and advance competent
and honest men in their employ. I think that on
this subject the indirect influence of <cite>The Nation</cite> was very
great, in furnishing arguments to men like myself, who never
lost an opportunity to restate them, and to editorial writers
for the Western newspapers, who generally read <cite>The Nation</cite>
and who were apt to reproduce its line of reasoning. When
I look back to 1869, the year in which I became a voter, and
recall the strenuous opposition to civil service reform on the
part of the politicians of both parties, and the indifference
of the public, I confess that I am amazed at the progress
which has been made. Such a reform is of course effected
only by a number of contributing causes and some favoring
circumstances, but I feel certain that it was accelerated by
the constant and vigorous support of <cite>The Nation</cite>.</p>

<p>I owe to <cite>The Nation</cite> more than to any other agency my
correct ideas on finance in two crises. The first was the
<a name="png.289" id="png.289"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">281</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&ldquo;greenback craze&rdquo; from 1869 to 1875. It was easy to be
a hard-money man in Boston or New York, where one might
imbibe the correct doctrine as one everywhere takes in the
fundamental principles of civilization and morality. But it
was not so in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, where the severe
money stringency before and during the panic of 1873, and
the depression after it, caused many good and representative
men to join in the cry for a larger issue of greenbacks by
the government. It required no moral courage for the average
citizen to resist what in 1875 seemed to be the popular
move, but it did require the correct knowledge and the forcible
arguments put forward weekly by <cite>The Nation</cite>. I do
not forget my indebtedness to John Sherman, Carl Schurz,
and Senator Thurman, but Sherman and Thurman were
not always consistent on this question, and Schurz&#8217;s voice
was only occasionally heard; but every seven days came
<cite>The Nation</cite> with its unremitting iteration, and it was an
iteration varied enough to be always interesting and worthy
of study. As one looks back over nearly forty years of politics
one likes to recall the occasions when one has done the
thing one&#8217;s mature judgment fully approves; and I like to
think that in 1875 I refused to vote for my party&#8217;s candidate
for governor, the Democratic William Allen, whose
platform was &ldquo;that the volume of currency be made and
kept equal to the wants of trade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A severer ordeal was the silver question of 1878, because
the argument for silver was more weighty than that for
irredeemable paper, and was believed to be sound by business
men of both parties. I remember that many representative
business men of Cleveland used to assemble around
the large luncheon table of the Union Club and discuss the
pending silver-coinage bill, which received the votes of both
of the senators from Ohio and of all her representatives
<a name="png.290" id="png.290"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">282</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>except Garfield. The gold men were in a minority also at the
luncheon table, but, fortified by <cite>The Nation</cite>, we thought
that we held our own in this daily discussion.</p>

<p>In my conversion from a belief in a protective tariff to
the advocacy of one for revenue only, I recognize an obligation
to Godkin, but his was only one of many influences.
I owe <cite>The Nation</cite> much for its accurate knowledge of foreign
affairs, especially of English politics, in which its readers
were enlightened by one of the most capable of living men,
Albert V. Dicey. I am indebted to it for sound ideas on
municipal government, and for its advocacy of many minor
measures, such for instance as the International Copyright
Bill. I owe it something for its later attitude on Reconstruction,
and its condemnation of the negro carpet-bag
governments in the South. In a word, <cite>The Nation</cite> was on
the side of civilization and good political morals.</p>

<p>Confessing thus my great political indebtedness to Godkin,
it is with some reluctance that I present a certain phase of
his thought which was regretted by many of his best friends,
and which undoubtedly limited his influence in the later
years of his life. A knowledge of this shortcoming is, however,
essential to a thorough comprehension of the man.
It is frequently said that Godkin rarely, if ever, made a retraction
or a rectification of personal charges shown to be
incorrect. A thorough search of <cite>The Nation&#8217;s</cite> columns
would be necessary fully to substantiate this statement, but
my own impression, covering as it does thirty-three years&#8217;
reading of the paper under Godkin&#8217;s control, inclines me
to believe in its truth, as I do not remember an instance of
the kind.</p>

<p>A grave fault of omission occurs to me as showing a regrettable
bias in a leader of intelligent opinion. On January 5,
1897, General Francis A. Walker died. He had served with
<a name="png.291" id="png.291"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">283</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>credit as an officer during our Civil War, and in two thoughtful
books had made a valuable contribution to its military
history. He was superintendent of the United States Census
of 1870, and did work that statisticians and historians
refer to with gratitude and praise. For sixteen years he
served with honor the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
as its president. He was a celebrated political economist,
his books being (I think) as well known in England
as in this country. Yale, Amherst, Harvard, Columbia,
St. Andrews, and Dublin conferred upon him the degree
of LL.D. Withal he served his city with public spirit.
Trinity Church, &ldquo;crowded and silent&rdquo; in celebrating its
last service over the dead body of Walker, witnessed one of
the three most impressive funerals which Boston has seen
for at least sixteen years&mdash;a funeral conspicuous for the
attendance of a large number of delegates from colleges and
learned societies.</p>

<p>Walker was distinctly of the intellectual élite of the country.
But <cite>The Nation</cite> made not the slightest reference to his
death. In the issue of January 7, appearing two days later,
I looked for an allusion in &ldquo;The Week,&rdquo; and subsequently
for one of those remarkable and discriminating eulogies,
which in smaller type follow the editorials, and for which <cite>The
Nation</cite> is justly celebrated; but there was not one word.
You might search the 1897 volume of <cite>The Nation</cite> and, but
for a brief reference in the April &ldquo;Notes&rdquo; to Walker&#8217;s annual
report posthumously published, you would not learn
that a great intellectual leader had passed away. I wrote
to a valued contributor of <cite>The Nation</cite>, a friend of Walker, of
Godkin, and of Wendell P. Garrison (the literary editor),
inquiring if he knew the reason for the omission, and in
answer he could only tell me that his amazement had been
as great as mine. He at first looked eagerly, and, when
<a name="png.292" id="png.292"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">284</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the last number came in which a eulogy could possibly
appear, he turned over the pages of <cite>The Nation</cite> with sorrowful
regret, hardly believing his eyes that the article he sought
was not there.</p>

<p>Now I suspect that the reason of this extraordinary omission
was due to the irreconcilable opinions of Walker and
Godkin on a question of finance. It was a period when the
contest between the advocates of a single gold standard and
the bimetallists raged fiercely, and the contest had not been
fully settled by the election of McKinley in 1896. Godkin
was emphatically for gold, Walker equally emphatic for a
double standard. And they clashed. It is a notable example
of the peculiarity of Godkin, to allow at the portal of
death the one point of political policy on which he and
Walker disagreed to overweigh the nine points in which
they were at one.</p>

<p>Most readers of <cite>The Nation</cite> noticed distinctly that, from
1895 on, its tone became more pessimistic and its criticism
was marked by greater acerbity. Mr. Rollo Ogden in his
biography shows that Godkin&#8217;s feeling of disappointment
over the progress of the democratic experiment in America,
and his hopelessness of our future, began at an earlier
date.</p>

<p>During his first years in the United States, he had no
desire to return to his mother country. When the financial
fortune of <cite>The Nation</cite> was doubtful, he wrote to Norton that
he should not go back to England except as a &ldquo;last extremity.
It would be going back into an atmosphere that
I detest, and a social system that I have hated since I was
fourteen years old.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.24"
 name="fna.xvi.24" id="fna.xvi.24">24</a></sup> In 1889, after an absence of twenty-seven
years, he went to England. The best intellectual
society of London and Oxford opened its doors to him and
<a name="png.293" id="png.293"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">285</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>he fell under its charm as would any American who was the
recipient of marked attentions from people of such distinction.
He began to draw contrasts which were not favorable
to his adopted country. &ldquo;I took a walk along the wonderful
Thames embankment,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;a splendid work,
and I sighed to think how impossible it would be to get such
a thing done in New York. The differences in government
and political manners are in fact awful, and for me very
depressing. Henry James [with whom he stopped in London]
and I talk over them sometimes &lsquo;des larmes dans la
<span class="rthinsp">voix.&rsquo;</span>&rdquo; In 1894, however, Godkin wrote in the <cite>Forum</cite>:
&ldquo;There is probably no government in the world to-day as
stable as that of the United States. The chief advantage
of democratic government is, in a country like this, the
enormous force it can command in an emergency.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.25"
 name="fna.xvi.25" id="fna.xvi.25">25</a></sup> But
next year his pessimism is clearly apparent. On January
12, 1895, he wrote to Norton: &ldquo;You see I am not sanguine
about the future of democracy. I think we shall have a
long period of decline like that which followed (?) the fall
of the Roman Empire, and then a recrudescence under
some other form of society.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.26"
 name="fna.xvi.26" id="fna.xvi.26">26</a></sup></p>

<p>A number of things had combined to affect him profoundly.
An admirer of Grover Cleveland and three times
a warm supporter of his candidacy for the Presidency, he
saw with regret the loss of his hold on his party, which was
drifting into the hands of the advocates of free silver. Then
in December, 1895, Godkin lost faith in his idol. &ldquo;I was
thunderstruck by Cleveland&#8217;s message&rdquo; on the Venezuela
question, he wrote to Norton. His submission to the Jingoes
&ldquo;is a terrible shock.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.27"
 name="fna.xvi.27" id="fna.xvi.27">27</a></sup> Later, in a calm review of passing
events, he called the message a &ldquo;sudden declaration of
<a name="png.294" id="png.294"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">286</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>war without notice against Great Britain.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.28"
 name="fna.xvi.28" id="fna.xvi.28">28</a></sup> The danger
of such a proceeding he had pointed out to Norton: Our
&ldquo;immense democracy, mostly ignorant &hellip; is constantly
on the brink of some frightful catastrophe like that which
overtook France in 1870.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.29"
 name="fna.xvi.29" id="fna.xvi.29">29</a></sup> In 1896 he was deeply distressed
at the country having to choose for President between
the arch-protectionist McKinley and the free-silver
advocate Bryan, for he had spent a good part of his life
combating a protective tariff and advocating sound money.
Though the <cite>Evening Post</cite> contributed powerfully to the election
of McKinley, from the fact that its catechism, teaching
financial truths in a popular form, was distributed throughout
the West in immense quantities by the chairman of the
Republican National Committee, Godkin himself refused to
vote for McKinley and put in his ballot for Palmer, the gold
Democrat.<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.30"
 name="fna.xvi.30" id="fna.xvi.30">30</a></sup></p>

<p>The Spanish-American war seems to have destroyed any
lingering hope that he had left for the future of American
democracy. He spoke of it as &ldquo;a perfectly avoidable war
forced on by a band of unscrupulous politicians&rdquo; who had
behind them &ldquo;a roaring mob.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.31"
 name="fna.xvi.31" id="fna.xvi.31">31</a></sup> The taking of the Philippines
and the subsequent war in these islands confirmed
him in his despair. In a private letter written from Paris,
he said, &ldquo;American ideals were the intellectual food of my
youth, and to see America converted into a senseless, Old-World
conqueror, embitters my age.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.32"
 name="fna.xvi.32" id="fna.xvi.32">32</a></sup> To another he
wrote that his former &ldquo;high and fond ideals about America
were now all shattered.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.33"
 name="fna.xvi.33" id="fna.xvi.33">33</a></sup> &ldquo;Sometimes he seemed to feel,&rdquo;
said his intimate friend, James Bryce, &ldquo;as though he had
labored in vain for forty years.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.34"
 name="fna.xvi.34" id="fna.xvi.34">34</a></sup></p>

<p><a name="png.295" id="png.295"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">287</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Such regrets expressed by an honest and sincere man
with a high ideal must command our respectful attention.
Though due in part to old age and enfeebled health, they are
still more attributable to his disappointment that the country
had not developed in the way that he had marked out
for her. For with men of Godkin&#8217;s positive convictions,
there is only one way to salvation. Sometimes such men
are true prophets; at other times, while they see clearly
certain aspects of a case, their narrowness of vision prevents
them from taking in the whole range of possibilities, especially
when the enthusiasm of manhood is gone.</p>

<p>Godkin took a broader view in 1868, which he forcibly
expressed in a letter to the London <cite>Daily News</cite>. &ldquo;There is
no careful and intelligent observer,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;whether he
be a friend to democracy or not, who can help admiring the
unbroken power with which the popular common sense&mdash;that
shrewdness, or intelligence, or instinct of self-preservation, I
care not what you call it, which so often makes the American
farmer a far better politician than nine tenths of the best
read European political philosophers&mdash;works under all
this tumult and confusion of tongues. The newspapers
and politicians fret and fume and shout and denounce; but
the great mass, the nineteen or twenty millions, work away
in the fields and workshops, saying little, thinking much,
hardy, earnest, self-reliant, very tolerant, very indulgent,
very shrewd, but ready whenever the government needs it,
with musket, or purse, or vote, as the case may be, laughing
and cheering occasionally at public meetings, but when you
meet them individually on the highroad or in their own
houses, very cool, then, sensible men, filled with no delusions,
carried away by no frenzies, believing firmly in the future
greatness and glory of the republic, but holding to no other
article of faith as essential to political salvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.296" id="png.296"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">288</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Before continuing the quotation I wish to call attention
to the fact that Godkin&#8217;s illustration was more effective in
1868 than now: then there was a solemn and vital meaning
to the prayers offered up for persons going to sea that they
might be preserved from the dangers of the deep. &ldquo;Every
now and then,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;as one watches the
political storms in the United States, one is reminded of
one&#8217;s feelings as one lies in bed on a stormy night in an ocean
steamer in a head wind. Each blow of the sea shakes the
ship from stem to stern, and every now and then a tremendous
one seems to paralyze her. The machinery seems to
stop work; there is a dead pause, and you think for a moment
the end has come; but the throbbing begins once
more, and if you go up on deck and look down in the
hold, you see the firemen and engineers at their posts,
apparently unconscious of anything but their work, and
as sure of getting into port as if there was not a ripple on
the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This letter of Godkin&#8217;s was written on January 8, 1868,
when Congress was engaged in the reconstruction of the South
on the basis of negro suffrage, when the quarrel between Congress
and President Johnson was acute and his impeachment
not two months off. At about this time Godkin set down
Evarts&#8217;s opinion that &ldquo;we are witnessing the decline of public
morality which usually presages revolution,&rdquo; and reported
that Howells was talking &ldquo;despondently like everybody
else about the condition of morals and manners.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.35"
 name="fna.xvi.35" id="fna.xvi.35">35</a></sup> Of like
tenor was the opinion of an arch-conservative, George Ticknor,
written in 1869, which bears a resemblance to the lamentation
of Godkin&#8217;s later years. &ldquo;The civil war of &#8217;61,&rdquo;
wrote Ticknor, &ldquo;has made a great gulf between what happened
before it in our century and what has happened
<a name="png.297" id="png.297"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">289</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>since, or what is likely to happen hereafter. It does not
seem to me as if I were living in the country in which I was
born, or in which I received whatever I ever got of political
education or principles. Webster seems to have been the
last of the Romans.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.36"
 name="fna.xvi.36" id="fna.xvi.36">36</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1868 Godkin was an optimist, having a cogent answer
to all gloomy predictions; from 1895 to 1902 he was a pessimist;
yet reasons just as strong may be adduced for considering
the future of the country secure in the later as were
urged in the earlier period. But as Godkin grew older, he
became a moral censor, and it is characteristic of censors to
exaggerate both the evil of the present and the good of the
past. Thus in 1899 he wrote of the years 1857&ndash;1860:
&ldquo;The air was full of the real Americanism. The American
gospel was on people&#8217;s lips and was growing with fervor.
Force was worshiped, but it was moral force: it was the force
of reason, of humanity, of human equality, of a good example.
The abolitionist gospel seemed to be permeating
the views of the American people, and overturning and
destroying the last remaining traditions of the old-world
public morality. It was really what might be called the
golden age of America.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.37"
 name="fna.xvi.37" id="fna.xvi.37">37</a></sup> These were the days of slavery.
James Buchanan was President. The internal policy of
the party in power was expressed in the Dred Scott decision
and the attempt to force slavery on Kansas; the foreign
policy, in the Ostend Manifesto, which declared that if Spain
would not sell Cuba, the United States would take it by force.
The rule in the civil service was, &ldquo;to the victors belong the
spoils.&rdquo; And New York City, where Godkin resided, had
for its mayor Fernando Wood.</p>

<p>In this somewhat rambling paper I have subjected Godkin
<a name="png.298" id="png.298"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">290</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to a severe test by a contrast of his public and private utterances
covering many years, not however with the intention
of accusing him of inconsistency. Ferrero writes that historians
of our day find it easy to expose the contradictions
of Cicero, but they forget that probably as much could
be said of his contemporaries, if we possessed also their
private correspondence. Similarly, it is a pertinent
question how many journalists and how many public
men would stand as well as Godkin in this matter of
consistency if we possessed the same abundant records of
their activity?</p>

<p>The more careful the study of Godkin&#8217;s utterances, the
less will be the irritation felt by men who love and believe
in their country. It is evident that he was a born critic,
and his private correspondence is full of expressions showing
that if he had been conducting a journal in England, his
criticism of certain phases of English policy would have
been as severe as those which he indulged in weekly at the
expense of this country. &ldquo;How Ireland sits heavy on your
soul!&rdquo; he wrote to James Bryce. &ldquo;Salisbury was an utterly
discredited Foreign Secretary when you brought up
Home Rule. Now he is one of the wisest of men. Balfour
and Chamberlain have all been lifted into eminence by
opposition to Home Rule simply.&rdquo; To Professor Norton:
&ldquo;Chamberlain is a capital specimen of the rise of an unscrupulous
politician.&rdquo; Again: &ldquo;The fall of England into
the hands of a creature like Chamberlain recalls the capture
of Rome by Alaric.&rdquo; To another friend: &ldquo;I do not like
to talk about the Boer War, it is too painful&hellip;. When
I do speak of the war my language becomes unfit for publication.&rdquo;
On seeing the Queen and the Prince of Wales
driving through the gardens at Windsor, his comment was
&ldquo;Fat, useless royalty;&rdquo; and in 1897 he wrote from England
<a name="png.299" id="png.299"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">291</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to Arthur Sedgwick, &ldquo;There are many things here which
reconcile me to America.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.38"
 name="fna.xvi.38" id="fna.xvi.38">38</a></sup></p>

<p>In truth, much of his criticism of America is only an elaboration
of his criticism of democracy. In common with
many Europeans born at about the same time, who began
their political life as radicals, he shows his keen disappointment
that democracy has not regenerated mankind.
&ldquo;There is not a country in the world, living under parliamentary
government,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;which has not begun to
complain of the decline in the quality of its legislators.
More and more, it is said, the work of government is falling
into the hands of men to whom even small pay is important,
and who are suspected of adding to their income by corruption.
The withdrawal of the more intelligent class from
legislative duties is more and more lamented, and the complaint
is somewhat justified by the mass of crude, hasty,
incoherent, and unnecessary laws which are poured on the
world at every session.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.39"
 name="fna.xvi.39" id="fna.xvi.39">39</a></sup></p>

<p>I have thus far spoken only of the political influence of
<cite>The Nation</cite>, but its literary department was equally important.
Associated with Godkin from the beginning was
Wendell P. Garrison, who became literary editor of the
journal, and, who, Godkin wrote in 1871, &ldquo;has really toiled
for six years with the fidelity of a Christian martyr and
upon the pay of an oysterman.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.40"
 name="fna.xvi.40" id="fna.xvi.40">40</a></sup> I have often heard the
literary criticism of <cite>The Nation</cite> called destructive like the
political, but, it appears to me, with less reason. Books
for review were sent to experts in different parts of the
country, and the list of contributors included many professors
from various colleges. While the editor, I believe,
<a name="png.300" id="png.300"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">292</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>retained, and sometimes exercised, the right to omit parts
of the review and make some additions, yet writers drawn
from so many sources must have preserved their own individuality.
I have heard it said that <cite>The Nation</cite> gave you
the impression of having been entirely written by one man;
but whatever there is more than fanciful in that impression
must have arisen from the general agreement between the
editor and the contributors. Paul Leicester Ford once told
me that, when he wrote a criticism for <cite>The Nation</cite>, he unconsciously
took on <cite>The Nation&#8217;s</cite> style, but he could write in
that way for no other journal, nor did he ever fall into it in
his books. Garrison was much more tolerant than is sometimes
supposed. I know of his sending many books to two
men, one of whom differed from him radically on the
negro question and the other on socialism.</p>

<p>It is only after hearing much detraction of the literary department
of <cite>The Nation</cite>, and after considerable reflection,
that I have arrived at the conviction that it came somewhat
near to realizing criticism as defined by Matthew Arnold,
thus: &ldquo;A disinterested endeavor to learn and propagate
the best that is known and thought in the world.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.41"
 name="fna.xvi.41" id="fna.xvi.41">41</a></sup> I am
well aware that it was not always equal, and I remember
two harsh reviews which ought not to have been printed;
but this simply proves that the editor was human and <cite>The
Nation</cite> was not perfect. I feel safe, however, in saying that
if the best critical reviews of <cite>The Nation</cite> were collected and
printed in book form, they would show an aspiration after
the standard erected by Sainte-Beuve and Matthew Arnold.</p>

<p>Again I must appeal to my individual experience. The
man who lived in the middle West for the twenty-five years
between 1865 and 1890 needed the literary department of
<cite>The Nation</cite> more than one who lived in Boston or New York.

 </span>Most of the books written in America were by New England,
New York, and Philadelphia authors, and in those communities
literary criticism was evolved by social contact in
clubs and other gatherings. We had nothing of the sort in
Cleveland, where a writer of books walking down Euclid
Avenue would have been stared at as a somewhat remarkable
personage. The literary columns of <cite>The Nation</cite> were
therefore our most important link between our practical
life and the literary world. I used to copy into my <em>Index
Rerum</em> long extracts from important reviews, in which the
writers appeared to have a thorough grasp of their subjects;
and these I read and re-read as I would a significant passage
in a favorite book. In the days when many of us were profoundly
influenced by Herbert Spencer&#8217;s &ldquo;Sociology,&rdquo; I was
somewhat astonished to read one week in <cite>The Nation</cite>, in a
review of Pollock&#8217;s &ldquo;Introduction to the Science of Politics,&rdquo;
these words: &ldquo;Herbert Spencer&#8217;s contributions to political
and historical science seem to us mere commonplaces, sometimes
false, sometimes true, but in both cases trying to disguise
their essential flatness and commonness in a garb of
dogmatic formalism.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.42"
 name="fna.xvi.42" id="fna.xvi.42">42</a></sup> Such an opinion, evidencing a conflict
between two intellectual guides, staggered me, and it
was with some curiosity that I looked subsequently, when
the <cite>Index to Periodicals</cite> came out, to see who had the temerity
thus to belittle Spencer&mdash;the greatest political philosopher,
so some of his disciples thought, since Aristotle.
I ascertained that the writer of the review was James Bryce,
and whatever else might be thought, it could not be denied
that the controversy was one between giants. I can, I
think, date the beginning of my emancipation from Spencer
from that review in 1891.</p>

<p>In the same year I read a discriminating eulogy of George
<a name="png.302" id="png.302"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">294</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Bancroft, ending with an intelligent criticism of his history,
which produced on me a marked impression. The reviewer
wrote: Bancroft falls into &ldquo;that error so common with the
graphic school of historians&mdash;the exaggerated estimate of
manuscripts or fragmentary material at the expense of what
is printed and permanent&hellip;. But a fault far more serious
than this is one which Mr. Bancroft shared with his
historical contemporaries, but in which he far exceeded any
of them&mdash;an utter ignoring of the very meaning and
significance of a quotation mark.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.43"
 name="fna.xvi.43" id="fna.xvi.43">43</a></sup> Sound and scientific
doctrine is this; and the whole article exhibited a thorough
knowledge of our colonial and revolutionary history which
inspired confidence in the conclusions of the writer, who, I
later ascertained, was Thomas Wentworth Higginson.</p>

<p>These two examples could be multiplied at length. There
were many reviewers from Harvard and Yale; and undoubtedly
other Eastern colleges were well represented. The
University of Wisconsin furnished at least one contributor,
as probably did the University of Michigan and other Western
colleges. Men in Washington, New York, and Boston, not
in academic life, were drawn upon; a soldier of the Civil War,
living in Cincinnati, a man of affairs, sent many reviews.
James Bryce was an occasional contributor, and at least
three notable reviews came from the pen of Albert V. Dicey.
In 1885, Godkin, in speaking of <cite>The Nation&#8217;s</cite> department of
Literature and Art, wrote that &ldquo;the list of those who have
contributed to the columns of the paper from the first issue
to the present day contains a large number of the most
eminent names in American literature, science, art, philosophy,
and law.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.44"
 name="fna.xvi.44" id="fna.xvi.44">44</a></sup> With men so gifted, and chosen from
all parts of the country, uniformly destructive criticism
could not have prevailed. Among them were optimists as
<a name="png.303" id="png.303"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">295</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>well as pessimists, and men as independent in thought as
was Godkin himself.</p>

<p>Believing that Godkin&#8217;s thirty-five years of critical work
was of great benefit to this country, I have sometimes asked
myself whether the fact of his being a foreigner has made
it more irritating to many good people, who term his criticism
&ldquo;fault-finding&rdquo; or &ldquo;scolding.&rdquo; Although he married
in America and his home life was centered here, he confessed
that in many essential things it was a foreign country.<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.45"
 name="fna.xvi.45" id="fna.xvi.45">45</a></sup>
Some readers who admired <cite>The Nation</cite> told Mr. Bryce that
they did not want &ldquo;to be taught by a European how to run
this republic.&rdquo; But Bryce, who in this matter is the most
competent of judges, intimates that Godkin&#8217;s foreign education,
giving him detachment and perspective, was a distinct
advantage. If it will help any one to a better appreciation
of the man, let Godkin be regarded as &ldquo;a chiel amang
us takin&#8217; notes&rdquo;; as an observer not so philosophic as
Tocqueville, not so genial and sympathetic as Bryce. Yet,
whether we look upon him as an Irishman, an Englishman,
or an American, let us rejoice that he cast his lot with us,
and that we have had the benefit of his illuminating pen.
He was not always right; he was sometimes unjust; he often
told the truth with &ldquo;needless asperity,&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.46"
 name="fna.xvi.46" id="fna.xvi.46">46</a></sup> as Parkman put
it; but his merits so outweighed his defects that he had a
marked influence on opinion, and probably on history,
during his thirty-five years of journalistic work, when, according
to James Bryce, he showed a courage such as is
rare everywhere.<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.47"
 name="fna.xvi.47" id="fna.xvi.47">47</a></sup> General J.&nbsp;D. Cox, who had not missed
a number of <cite>The Nation</cite> from 1865 to 1899, wrote to Godkin,
on hearing of his prospective retirement from the <cite>Evening
Post</cite>, &ldquo;I really believe that earnest men, all over the land,
whether they agree with you or differ, will unite in the
<a name="png.304" id="png.304"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">296</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>exclamation which Lincoln made as to Grant, &lsquo;We can&#8217;t
spare this man&mdash;he <span class="rthinsp"><em>fights</em>.&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.48"
 name="fna.xvi.48" id="fna.xvi.48">48</a></sup></p>

<p>Our country, wrapped up in no smug complacency, listened
to this man, respected him and supported him, and
on his death a number of people were glad to unite to endow
a lectureship in his honor in Harvard University.</p>

<p>In closing, I cannot do better than quote what may be
called Godkin&#8217;s farewell words, printed forty days before
the attack of cerebral hemorrhage which ended his active
career. &ldquo;The election of the chief officer of the state by
universal suffrage,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;by a nation approaching one
hundred millions, is not simply a novelty in the history of
man&#8217;s efforts to govern himself, but an experiment of which
no one can foresee the result. The mass is yearly becoming
more and more difficult to move. The old arts of persuasion
are already ceasing to be employed on it. Presidential
elections are less and less carried by speeches and articles.
The American people is a less instructed people than it
used to be. The necessity for drilling, organizing, and guiding
it, in order to extract the vote from it is becoming plain;
and out of this necessity has arisen the boss system, which
is now found in existence everywhere, is growing more
powerful, and has thus far resisted all attempts to overthrow
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shall not stop to urge a qualification of some of these
statements, but will proceed to the brighter side of our case,
which Godkin, even in his pessimistic mood, could not fail
to see distinctly. &ldquo;On the other hand,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I
think the progress made by the colleges throughout the
country, big and little, both in the quality of the instruction
and in the amount of money devoted to books,
laboratories, and educational facilities of all kinds, is
<a name="png.305" id="png.305"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">297</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>something unparalleled in the history of the civilized world.
And the progress of the nation in all the arts, except that of
government, in science, in literature, in commerce, in invention,
is something unprecedented and becomes daily more
astonishing. How it is that this splendid progress does not
drag on politics with it I do not profess to know.&rdquo;<sup><a href="#fn.xvi.49"
 name="fna.xvi.49" id="fna.xvi.49">49</a></sup></p>

<p>Let us be as hopeful as was Godkin in his earlier days, and
rest assured that intellectual training will eventually exert
its power in politics, as it has done in business and in other
domains of active life.</p>

<p>A paper read before the Massachusetts Historical Society at the
November meeting of 1901, and printed in the <cite>American Historical
Review</cite> of April, 1902.</p>

 /></span>WHO BURNED COLUMBIA?</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story goes that when General Sherman lived in New
York City, which was during the last five years of his life,
he attended one night a dinner party at which he and an
ex-Confederate general who had fought against him in the
southwest were the chief guests; and that an Englishman
present asked in perfect innocence the question, Who
burned Columbia? Had bombshells struck the tents of
these generals during the war, they would not have caused
half the commotion in their breasts that did this question
put solely with the desire of information. The emphatic
language of Sherman interlarded with the oaths he uttered
spontaneously, the bitter charges of the Confederate, the
pounding of the table, the dancing of the glasses, told the
Englishman that the bloody chasm had not been entirely
filled. With a little variation and with some figurative
meaning, he might have used the words of Iago: &ldquo;Friends all
but now, even now in peace; and then but now as if some
planet had outwitted men, tilting at one another&#8217;s breast in
opposition. I cannot speak any beginning to this peevish
odds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the question which disturbed the New York dinner
party is a delight to the historian. Feeling that history may
be known best when there are most documents, he may derive
the greatest pleasure from a perusal of the mass of evidence
bearing on this disputed point; and if he is of Northern
birth he ought to approach the subject with absolute candor.
Of a Southerner who had himself lost property or
<a name="png.310" id="png.310"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">302</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>whose parents had lost property, through Sherman&#8217;s campaign
of invasion, it would be asking too much to expect
him to consider this subject in a judicial spirit. Even Trent,
a moderate and impartial Southern writer whose tone is a
lesson to us all, when referring, in his life of William Gilmore
Simms, to &ldquo;the much vexed question, Who burned Columbia,&rdquo;
used words of the sternest condemnation.</p>

<p>Sherman, with his army of 60,000, left Savannah February
1, 1865, and reached the neighborhood of Columbia February
16. The next day Columbia was evacuated by the Confederates,
occupied by troops of the fifteenth corps of the Federal
army, and by the morning of the 18th either three
fifths or two thirds of the town lay in ashes. The facts
contained in these two sentences are almost the only ones
undisputed. We shall consider this episode most curiously
if we take first Sherman&#8217;s account, then Wade Hampton&#8217;s,
ending with what I conceive to be a true relation.</p>

<p>The city was surrendered by the mayor and three aldermen
to Colonel George A. Stone at the head of his brigade.
Soon afterwards Sherman and Howard, the commander of
the right wing of the army, rode into the city; they observed
piles of cotton burning, and Union soldiers and citizens working
to extinguish the fire, which was partially subdued.
Let Sherman speak for himself in the first account that he
wrote, which was his report of April 4, 1865: &ldquo;Before one
single public building had been fired by order, the smouldering
fires [cotton] set by Hampton&#8217;s order were rekindled
by the wind, and communicated to the buildings around.
[Wade Hampton commanded the Confederate cavalry.]
About dark they began to spread, and got beyond the
control of the brigade on duty within the city. The whole
of Woods&#8217; division was brought in, but it was found impossible
to check the flames, which, by midnight, had become
<a name="png.311" id="png.311"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">303</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>unmanageable, and raged until about 4&nbsp;<span class="smcap lc">A.M.</span>, when the
wind subsiding, they were got under control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was up nearly all night, and saw Generals Howard,
Logan, Woods, and others, laboring to save houses and protect
families thus suddenly deprived of shelter, and even of
bedding and wearing apparel. I disclaim on the part of
my army any agency in this fire, but, on the contrary, claim
that we saved what of Columbia remains unconsumed. And
without hesitation I charge General Wade Hampton with
having burned his own city of Columbia, not with a malicious
intent or as the manifestation of a silly &lsquo;Roman stoicism,&rsquo;
but from folly, and want of sense, in filling it with
lint, cotton, and tinder. Our officers and men on duty
worked well to extinguish the flames; but others not on
duty, including the officers who had long been imprisoned
there, rescued by us, may have assisted in spreading the fire
after it had once begun, and may have indulged in unconcealed
joy to see the ruin of the capital of South Carolina.&rdquo;
Howard, in his report, with some modification agrees with
his chief, and the account in &ldquo;The March to the Sea&rdquo; of
General Cox, whose experience and training fitted him well
to weigh the evidence, gives at least a partial confirmation
to Sherman&#8217;s theory of the origin of the fire.</p>

<p>I have not, however, discovered sufficient evidence to
support the assertion of Sherman that Wade Hampton
ordered the cotton in the streets of Columbia to be burned.
Nor do I believe Sherman knew a single fact on which he
might base so positive a statement.<sup><a href="#fn.xvii.1"
 name="fna.xvii.1" id="fna.xvii.1">1</a></sup> It had generally been
the custom for the Confederates in their retreat to burn
<a name="png.312" id="png.312"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">304</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>cotton to prevent its falling into the hands of the invading
army, and because such was the general rule Sherman
assumed that it had been applied in this particular case. This
assumption suited his interest, as he sought a victim to whom
he might charge the burning of Columbia. His statement
in his &ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo; published in 1875, is a delicious bit of historical
naïveté. &ldquo;In my official report of this conflagration,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;I distinctly charged it to General Wade
Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly, to shake the faith
of his people in him, for he was in my opinion boastful and
professed to be the special champion of South Carolina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of Hampton giving an order to burn the cotton,
I am satisfied that he urged Beauregard, the general in command,
to issue an order that this cotton should not be burned,
lest the fire might spread to the shops and houses, which for
the most part were built of wood, and I am further satisfied
that such an order was given. Unfortunately the evidence
for this is not contemporary. No such order is printed in the
&ldquo;Official Records,&rdquo; and I am advised from the War Department
that no such order has been found. The nearest evidence
to the time which I have discovered is a letter of
Wade Hampton of April 21, 1866, and one of Beauregard
of May 2, 1866. Since these dates, there is an abundance
of evidence, some of it sworn testimony, and while it is mixed
up with inaccurate statements on another point, and all of it
is of the nature of recollections, I cannot resist the conclusion
that Beauregard and Hampton gave such an order.
It was unquestionably the wise thing to do. There was absolutely
no object in burning the cotton, as the Federal
troops could not carry it with them and could not ship it to
any seaport which was under Union control.</p>

<p>An order of Beauregard issued two days after the burning of
Columbia and printed in the &ldquo;Official Records&rdquo; shows that

 </span>the policy of burning cotton to keep it out of the hands of
Sherman&#8217;s army had been abandoned. Sherman&#8217;s charge,
then, that Wade Hampton burned Columbia, falls to the
ground. The other part of his account, in which he maintained
that the fire spread to the buildings from the smoldering
cotton rekindled by the wind, which was blowing a
gale, deserves more respect. His report saying that he
saw cotton afire in the streets was written April 4, 1865,
and Howard&#8217;s in which the same fact is stated was written
April 1, very soon after the event, when their recollection
would be fresh. All of the Southern evidence (except one
statement, the most important of all) is to the effect that
no cotton was burning until after the Federal troops
entered the city. Many Southerners in their testimony
before the British and American mixed commission under
examination and cross-examination swear to this; and
Wade Hampton swears that he was one of the last Confederates
to leave the city, and that, when he left, no cotton
was afire, and he knew that it was not fired by his men.
But this testimony was taken in 1872 and 1873, and may be
balanced by the sworn testimony of Sherman, Howard, and
other Union officers before the same commission in 1872.</p>

<p>The weight of the evidence already referred to would
seem to me to show that cotton was afire when the Federal
troops entered Columbia, but a contemporary statement of
a Confederate officer puts it beyond doubt. Major Chambliss,
who was endeavoring to secure the means of transportation
for the Confederate ordnance and ordnance stores,
wrote, in a letter of February 20, that at three o&#8217;clock on
the morning of February 17, which was a number of hours
before the Union soldiers entered Columbia, &ldquo;the city was
illuminated with burning cotton.&rdquo; But it does not follow
that the burning cotton in the streets of Columbia was the
<a name="png.314" id="png.314"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">306</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>cause of the fire which destroyed the city. When we come
to the probably correct account of the incident, we shall see
that the preponderance of the evidence points to another
cause.</p>

<p>February 27, ten days after the fire, Wade Hampton, in a
letter to Sherman, charged him with having permitted the
burning of Columbia, if he did not order it directly; and this
has been iterated later by many Southern writers. The
correspondence between Halleck and Sherman is cited to
show premeditation on the part of the general. &ldquo;Should
you capture Charleston,&rdquo; wrote Halleck, December 18, 1864,
&ldquo;I hope that by some accident the place may be destroyed,
and if a little salt should be sown upon the site it may prevent
the growth of future crops of nullification and secession.&rdquo;
Sherman thus replied six days later: &ldquo;I will bear in mind
your hint as to Charleston, and don&#8217;t think salt will be
necessary. When I move, the Fifteenth Corps will be on the
right of the Right Wing, and their position will bring them
naturally into Charleston first; and if you have watched the
history of that corps you will have remarked that they generally
do their work up pretty well. The truth is, the whole
army is burning with an insatiable desire to wreak vengeance
on South Carolina. I almost tremble at her fate, but feel
that she deserves all that seems in store for her&hellip;. I
look upon Columbia as quite as bad as Charleston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The evidence from many points of view corroborating
this statement of the feeling of the army towards South
Carolina is ample. The rank and file of Sherman&#8217;s army
were men of some education and intelligence; they were
accustomed to discuss public matters, weigh reasons, and
draw conclusions. They thought that South Carolina had
brought on the Civil War, was responsible for the cost and
bloodshed of it, and no punishment for her could be too
<a name="png.315" id="png.315"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">307</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>severe. That was likewise the sentiment of the officers. A characteristic
expression of the feeling may be found in a home
letter of Colonel Charles F. Morse, of the second Massachusetts,
who speaks of the &ldquo;miserable, rebellious State of South
Carolina.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pity for these inhabitants,&rdquo; he further writes,
&ldquo;I have none. In the first place, they are rebels, and I am
almost prepared to agree with Sherman that a rebel has no
rights, not even the right to live except by our permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is no wonder, then, that Southern writers, smarting at
the loss caused by Sherman&#8217;s campaign of invasion, should
believe that Sherman connived at the destruction of Columbia.
But they are wrong in that belief. The general&#8217;s
actions were not so bad as his words. Before his troops
made their entrance he issued this order: &ldquo;General Howard
will &hellip; occupy Columbia, destroy the public buildings,
railroad property, manufacturing and machine shops, but
will spare libraries and asylums and private dwellings.&rdquo;
That Sherman was entirely sincere when he gave this order,
and that his general officers endeavored to carry it out cannot
be questioned. A statement which he made under oath
in 1872 indicates that he did not connive at the destruction
of Columbia. &ldquo;If I had made up my mind to burn Columbia,&rdquo;
he declared, &ldquo;I would have burnt it with no more feeling
than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did
not do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other words of his exhibit without disguise his feelings
in regard to the occurrence which the South has regarded as
a piece of wanton mischief. &ldquo;The ulterior and strategic
advantages of the occupation of Columbia are seen now
clearly by the result,&rdquo; said Sherman under oath. &ldquo;The
burning of the private dwellings, though never designed by
me, was a trifling matter compared with the manifold results
that soon followed. Though I never ordered it and never
<a name="png.316" id="png.316"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">308</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>wished it, I have never shed many tears over the event,
because I believe it hastened what we all fought for, the end
of the war.&rdquo; It is true that he feared previous to their entry
the burning of Columbia by his soldiers, owing to their
&ldquo;deep-seated feeling of hostility&rdquo; to the town, but no general
of such an army during such a campaign of invasion
would have refused them the permission to occupy the capital
city of South Carolina. &ldquo;I could have had them stay
in the ranks,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but I would not have done it
under the circumstances to save Columbia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Historical and legal canons for weighing evidence are not
the same. It is a satisfaction, however, when after the investigation
of any case they lead to the same decision. The
members of the British and American mixed commission
(an Englishman, an American, and the Italian Minister at
Washington), having to adjudicate upon claims for &ldquo;property
alleged to have been destroyed by the burning of
Columbia, on the allegation that that city was wantonly fired
by the army of General Sherman, either under his orders
or with his consent and permission,&rdquo; disallowed all the
claims, &ldquo;all the commissioners agreeing.&rdquo; While they were
not called upon to deliver a formal opinion in the case,
the American agent was advised &ldquo;that the commissioners
were unanimous in the conclusion that the conflagration
which destroyed Columbia was not to be ascribed to either
the intention or default of either the Federal or Confederate
officers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To recapitulate, then, what I think I have established:
Sherman&#8217;s account and that of the Union writers who follow
him cannot be accepted as history. Neither is the version
of Wade Hampton and the Southern writers worthy of
credence. Let me now give what I am convinced is the
true relation. My authorities are the contemporary
<a name="png.317" id="png.317"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">309</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>accounts of six Federal officers, whose names will appear when
the evidence is presented in detail; the report of Major
Chambliss of the Confederate army; &ldquo;The Sack and Destruction
of Columbia,&rdquo; a series of articles in the <cite>Columbia
Ph&oelig;nix</cite>, written by William Gilmore Simms and printed a
little over a month after the event; and a letter written
from Charlotte, February 22, to the <cite>Richmond Whig</cite>, by
F.&nbsp;G. de&nbsp;F., who remained in Columbia until the day before
the entrance of the Union troops.</p>

<p>Two days before the entrance of the Federal troops,
Columbia was placed under martial law, but this did not
prevent some riotous conduct after nightfall and a number
of highway robberies; stores were also broken into and
robbed. There was great disorder and confusion in the
preparations of the inhabitants for flight; it was a frantic
attempt to get themselves and their portable belongings
away before the enemy should enter the city. &ldquo;A party
of Wheeler&#8217;s Cavalry,&rdquo; wrote F.&nbsp;G. de&nbsp;F. to the <cite>Richmond
Whig</cite>, &ldquo;accompanied by their officers dashed into town
[February 16], tied their horses, and as systematically as if
they had been bred to the business, proceeded to break into
the stores along Main Street and rob them of their contents.&rdquo;
Early in the morning of the 17th, the South Carolina railroad
depot took fire through the reckless operations of a
band of greedy plunderers, who while engaged in robbing
&ldquo;the stores of merchants and planters, trunks of treasure,
wares and goods of fugitives,&rdquo; sent there awaiting shipment,
fired, by the careless use of their lights, a train leading to a
number of kegs of powder; the explosion which followed
killed many of the thieves and set fire to the building.
Major Chambliss, who was endeavoring to secure the means
of transportation for the Confederate ordnance and ordnance
stores, wrote: &ldquo;The straggling cavalry and rabble
<a name="png.318" id="png.318"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">310</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>were stripping the warehouses and railroad depots. The
city was in the wildest terror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Union soldiers of Colonel Stone&#8217;s brigade entered
the city, they were at once supplied by citizens and
negroes with large quantities of intoxicating liquor, brought
to them in cups, bottles, demijohns, and buckets. Many
had been without supper, and all of them without sleep the
night before, and none had eaten breakfast that morning.
They were soon drunk, excited, and unmanageable. The
stragglers and &ldquo;bummers,&rdquo; who had increased during the
march through South Carolina, were now attracted by the
opportunity for plunder and swelled the crowd. Union
prisoners of war had escaped from their places of confinement
in the city and suburbs, and joining their comrades were
eager to avenge their real or fancied injuries. Convicts in the
jail had in some manner been released. The pillage of shops
and houses and the robbing of men in the streets began soon
after the entrance of the army. The officers tried to preserve
discipline. Colonel Stone ordered all the liquor to
be destroyed, and furnished guards for the private property
of citizens and for the public buildings; but the extent of
the disorder and plundering during the day was probably
not appreciated by Sherman and those high in command.
Stone was hampered in his efforts to preserve order by the
smallness of his force for patrol duty and by the drunkenness
of his men. In fact, the condition of his men was such that
at eight o&#8217;clock in the evening they were relieved from provost
duty, and a brigade of the same division, who had been
encamped outside of the city during the day, took their
place. But the mob of convicts, escaped Union prisoners,
stragglers and &ldquo;bummers,&rdquo; drunken soldiers and negroes,
Union soldiers who were eager to take vengeance on South
Carolina, could not be controlled. The sack of the city
<a name="png.319" id="png.319"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">311</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>went on, and when darkness came, the torch was applied to
many houses; the high wind carried the flames from building
to building, until the best part of Columbia&mdash;a city of
eight thousand inhabitants&mdash;was destroyed.</p>

<p>Colonel Stone wrote, two days afterwards: &ldquo;About eight
o&#8217;clock the city was fired in a number of places by some
of our escaped prisoners and citizens.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo;
said General W.&nbsp;B. Woods, commander of the brigade that
relieved Stone, in his report of March 26, &ldquo;by statements
made to me by respectable citizens of the town, that the
fire was first set by the negro inhabitants.&rdquo; General C.&nbsp;R.
Woods, commander of the first division, fifteenth corps,
wrote, February 21: &ldquo;The town was fired in several different
places by the villains that had that day been improperly
freed from their confinement in the town prison. The town
itself was full of drunken negroes and the vilest vagabond
soldiers, the veriest scum of the entire army being collected
in the streets.&rdquo; The very night of the conflagration he
spoke of the efforts &ldquo;to arrest the countless villains of every
command that were roaming over the streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>General Logan, commander of the fifteenth corps, said,
in his report of March 31: &ldquo;The citizens had so crazed our
men with liquor that it was almost impossible to control
them. The scenes in Columbia that night were terrible.
Some fiend first applied the torch, and the wild flames leaped
from house to house and street to street, until the lower
and business part of the city was wrapped in flames.
Frightened citizens rushed in every direction, and the reeling
incendiaries dashed, torch in hand, from street to street,
spreading dismay wherever they went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some escaped prisoners,&rdquo; wrote General Howard, commander
of the right wing, April 1, &ldquo;convicts from the penitentiary
just broken open, army followers, and drunken
<a name="png.320" id="png.320"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">312</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>soldiers ran through house after house, and were doubtless
guilty of all manner of villainies, and it is these men that I
presume set new fires farther and farther to the windward
in the northern part of the city. Old men, women, and
children, with everything they could get, were herded together
in the streets. At some places we found officers and
kind-hearted soldiers protecting families from the insults
and roughness of the careless. Meanwhile the flames made
fearful ravages, and magnificent residences and churches
were consumed in a very few minutes.&rdquo; All these quotations
are from Federal officers who were witnesses of the
scene and who wrote their accounts shortly after the event,
without collusion or dictation. They wrote too before they
knew that the question, Who burned Columbia? would
be an irritating one in after years. These accounts are
therefore the best of evidence. Nor does the acceptance
of any one of them imply the exclusion of the others. All
may be believed, leading us to the conclusion that all the
classes named had a hand in the sack and destruction of
Columbia.</p>

<p>When the fire was well under way, Sherman appeared on
the scene, but gave no orders. Nor was it necessary, for
Generals Howard, Logan, Woods, and others were laboring
earnestly to prevent the spread of the conflagration. By
their efforts and by the change and subsidence of wind, the
fire in the early morning of February 18 was stayed. Columbia,
wrote General Howard, was little &ldquo;except a blackened
surface peopled with numerous chimneys and an occasional
house that had been spared as if by a miracle.&rdquo;
Science, history, and art might mourn at the loss they sustained
in the destruction of the house of Dr. Gibbes, an
antiquary and naturalist, a scientific acquaintance, if not a
friend, of Agassiz. His large library, portfolios of fine
<a name="png.321" id="png.321"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">313</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>engravings, two hundred paintings, a remarkable cabinet of
Southern fossils, a collection of sharks&#8217; teeth, &ldquo;pronounced
by Agassiz to be the finest in the world,&rdquo; relics of our aborigines
and others from Mexico, &ldquo;his collection of historical
documents, original correspondence of the Revolution, especially
that of South Carolina,&rdquo; were all burned.</p>

<p>The story of quelling the disorder is told by General
Oliver: &ldquo;February 18, at 4&nbsp;<span class="smcap lc">A.M.</span>, the Third Brigade was
called out to suppress riot; did so, killing 2 men, wounding
30 and arresting 370.&rdquo; It is worthy of note that, despite
the reign of lawlessness during the night, very few, if any,
outrages were committed on women.</p>

In a letter presented to the Senate of the United States (some while
before April 21, 1866) Sherman said, &ldquo;I saw in your Columbia newspaper the
printed order of General Wade Hampton that on the approach of the Yankee
army all the cotton should be burned&rdquo; (<cite>South. Hist. Soc. Papers</cite>, VII, 156).</p>

 /></span>A NEW ESTIMATE OF CROMWELL</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most notable contributions to the historical literature
of England during the year 1897 are two volumes by
Samuel R. Gardiner: the Oxford lectures, &ldquo;Cromwell&#8217;s Place
in History,&rdquo; published in the spring; and the second volume
of &ldquo;History of the Commonwealth and Protectorate,&rdquo; which
appeared in the autumn. These present what is probably
a new view of Cromwell.</p>

<p>If one loves a country or an historic epoch, it is natural
for the mind to seek a hero to represent it. We are fortunate
in having Washington and Lincoln, whose characters
and whose lives sum up well the periods in which they were
our benefactors. But if we look upon our history as being
the continuation of a branch of that of England, who is the
political hero in the nation from which we sprang who represents
a great principle or idea that we love to cherish?
Hampden might answer if only we knew more about him.
It occurs to me that Gray, in his poem which is read and
conned from boyhood to old age, has done more than any
one else to spread abroad the fame of Hampden. Included
in the same stanza with Milton and with Cromwell, he seems
to the mere reader of the poem to occupy the same place in
history. In truth, however, as Mr. Gardiner writes, &ldquo;it is
remarkable how little can be discovered about Hampden.
All that is known is to his credit, but his greatness appears
from the impression he created upon others more than from
the circumstances of his own life as they have been handed
down to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.326" id="png.326"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">318</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The minds of American boys educated under Puritan
influences before and during the war of secession accordingly
turned to Cromwell. Had our Puritan ancestors remained
at home till the civil war in England, they would have fought
under the great Oliver, and it is natural that their descendants
should venerate him. All young men of the period
of which I am speaking, who were interested in history,
read Macaulay, the first volume of whose history appeared
in 1848, and they found in Cromwell a hero to their liking.
Carlyle&#8217;s Cromwell was published three years before, and
those who could digest stronger food found the great man
therein portrayed a chosen one of God to lead his people in
the right path. Everybody echoed the thought of Carlyle
when he averred that ten years more of Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s
life would have given another history to all the centuries of
England.</p>

<p>In these two volumes Gardiner presents a different conception
of Cromwell from that of Carlyle and Macaulay,
and in greater detail. We arrive at Gardiner&#8217;s notion
by degrees, being prepared by the reversal of some of
our pretty well established opinions about the Puritans.
Macaulay&#8217;s epigrammatic sentence touching their attitude
towards amusements undoubtedly colored the opinions of
men for at least a generation. &ldquo;The Puritan hated bear-baiting,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;not because it gave pain to the bear, but
because it gave pleasure to the spectators.&rdquo; How coolly
Gardiner disposes of this well-turned rhetorical phrase:
&ldquo;The order for the complete suppression of bear-baiting
and bull-baiting at Southwark and elsewhere was grounded,
not, as has been often repeated, on Puritan aversion to
amusements giving &lsquo;pleasure to the spectators,&rsquo; but upon
Puritan disgust at the immorality which these exhibitions
fostered.&rdquo; Again he writes: &ldquo;Zealous as were the leaders
<a name="png.327" id="png.327"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">319</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of the Commonwealth in the suppression of vice, they displayed
but little of that sour austerity with which they have
frequently been credited. On his way to Dunbar, Cromwell
laughed heartily at the sight of one soldier overturning
a full cream tub and slamming it down on the head of another,
whilst on his return from Worcester he spent a day
hawking in the fields near Aylesbury. &lsquo;Oliver,&rsquo; we hear,
&lsquo;loved an innocent jest.&rsquo; Music and song were cultivated
in his family. If the graver Puritans did not admit what has
been called &lsquo;promiscuous dancing&rsquo; into their households,
they made no attempt to prohibit it elsewhere.&rdquo; In the
spring of 1651 appeared the &ldquo;English Dancing Master,&rdquo; containing
rules for country dances, and the tunes by which
they were to be accompanied.</p>

<p>Macaulay&#8217;s description of Cromwell&#8217;s army has so pervaded
our literature as to be accepted as historic truth;
and J.&nbsp;R. Green, acute as he was, seems, consciously or
unconsciously, to have been affected by it, which is not a
matter of wonderment, indeed, for such is its rhetorical
force that it leaves an impression hard to be obliterated.
Macaulay writes: &ldquo;That which chiefly distinguished the
army of Cromwell from other armies was the austere morality
and the fear of God which pervaded all ranks. It is acknowledged
by the most zealous Royalists that in that singular
camp no oath was heard, no drunkenness or gambling was
seen, and that during the long dominion of the soldiery the
property of the peaceable citizen and the honor of woman
were held sacred. If outrages were committed, they were
outrages of a very different kind from those of which a
victorious army is generally guilty. No servant girl complained
of the rough gallantry of the redcoats; not an ounce
of plate was taken from the shops of the goldsmiths; but
a Pelagian sermon, or a window on which the Virgin and
<a name="png.328" id="png.328"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">320</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Child were painted, produced in the Puritan ranks an excitement
which it required the utmost exertions of the officers
to quell. One of Cromwell&#8217;s chief difficulties was to
restrain his musketeers and dragoons from invading by
main force the pulpits of ministers whose discourses, to use
the language of that time, were not savory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a different impression we get from Gardiner!
&ldquo;Much that has been said of Cromwell&#8217;s army has no evidence
behind it,&rdquo; he declares. &ldquo;The majority of the soldiers
were pressed men, selected because they had strong
bodies, and not because of their religion. The remainder
were taken out of the armies already in existence&hellip;. The
distinctive feature of the army was its officers. All existing
commands having been vacated, men of a distinctly Puritan
and for the most part of an Independent type were appointed
to their places&hellip;. The strictest discipline was enforced,
and the soldiers, whether Puritan or not, were thus brought
firmly under the control of officers bent upon the one object,
of defeating the king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To those who have regarded the men who governed England,
from the time the Long Parliament became supreme
to the death of Cromwell, as saints in conduct as well as in
name, Mr. Gardiner&#8217;s facts about the members of the rump
of the Long Parliament will be an awakening. &ldquo;It was
notorious,&rdquo; he records, &ldquo;that many members who entered
the House poor were now rolling in wealth.&rdquo; From Gardiner&#8217;s
references and quotations, it is not a strained inference
that in subjection to lobbying, in log-rolling and corruption,
this Parliament would hardly be surpassed by a
corrupt American legislature. As to personal morality, he
by implication confirms the truth of Cromwell&#8217;s bitter speech
on the memorable day when he forced the dissolution of
the Long Parliament. &ldquo;Some of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are
<a name="png.329" id="png.329"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">321</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>whoremasters. Others,&rdquo; he continued, pointing to one and another
with his hands, &ldquo;are drunkards, and some corrupt
and unjust men, and scandalous to the profession of the
gospel. It is not fit that you should sit as a Parliament any
longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I am well aware that to him, who makes but a casual
study of any historic period, matters will appear fresh that
to the master of it are well-worn inferences and generalizations,
and while therefore I can pretend to offer only a
shallow experience, I confess that on the points to which I
have referred I received new light, and it prepared me for
the overturning of the view of Cromwell which I had derived
from the Puritanical instruction of my early days and from
Macaulay.</p>

<p>In his foreign policy Cromwell was irresolute, vacillating
and tricky. &ldquo;A study of the foreign policy of the Protectorate,&rdquo;
writes Mr. Gardiner, &ldquo;reveals a distracting maze of
fluctuations. Oliver is seen alternately courting France
and Spain, constant only in inconstancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cromwell lacked constructive statesmanship. &ldquo;The
tragedy of his career lies in the inevitable result that his
efforts to establish religion and morality melted away as
the morning mist, whilst his abiding influence was built upon
the vigor with which he promoted the material aims of his
countrymen.&rdquo; In another place Mr. Gardiner says: &ldquo;Cromwell&#8217;s
negative work lasted; his positive work vanished
away. His constitutions perished with him, his Protectorate
descended from the proud position to which he had
raised it, his peace with the Dutch Republic was followed
by two wars with the United Provinces, his alliance with
the French monarchy only led to a succession of wars with
France lasting into the nineteenth century. All that lasted
was the support given by him to maritime enterprise, and
<a name="png.330" id="png.330"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">322</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in that he followed the tradition of the governments preceding
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What is Cromwell&#8217;s place in history? Thus Mr. Gardiner
answers the question: &ldquo;He stands forth as the typical Englishman
of the modern world&hellip;. It is in England that
his fame has grown up since the publication of Carlyle&#8217;s
monumental work, and it is as an Englishman that he must
be judged&hellip;. With Cromwell&#8217;s memory it has fared as
with ourselves. Royalists painted him as a devil. Carlyle
painted him as the masterful saint who suited his peculiar
Valhalla. It is time for us to regard him as he really was,
with all his physical and moral audacity, with all his tenderness
and spiritual yearnings, in the world of action what
Shakespeare was in the world of thought, the greatest because
the most typical Englishman of all time. This, in
the most enduring sense, is Cromwell&#8217;s place in history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea most difficult for me to relinquish is that of
Cromwell as a link in that historic chain which led to the
Revolution of 1688, with its blessed combination of liberty
and order. I have loved to think, as Carlyle expressed it:
&ldquo;<span class="lthinsp">&lsquo;Their</span> works follow them,&rsquo; as I think this Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s
works have done and are still doing! We have had
our &lsquo;Revolution of &#8217;88&rsquo; officially called &lsquo;glorious,&rsquo; and other
Revolutions not yet called glorious; and somewhat has been
gained for poor mankind. Men&#8217;s ears are not now slit off
by rash Officiality. Officiality will for long henceforth
be more cautious about men&#8217;s ears. The tyrannous star
chambers, branding irons, chimerical kings and surplices at
Allhallowtide, they are gone or with immense velocity going.
Oliver&#8217;s works do follow him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these two volumes of Gardiner it is not from what is
said, but from what is omitted, that one may deduce the
author&#8217;s opinion that Cromwell&#8217;s career as Protector
<a name="png.331" id="png.331"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">323</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>contributed in no wise to the Revolution of 1688. But touching
this matter he has thus written to me: &ldquo;I am inclined to
question your view that Cromwell paved the way for the
Revolution of 1688, except so far as his victories and the
King&#8217;s execution frightened off James II. Pym and Hampden
did pave the way, but Cromwell&#8217;s work took other lines.
The Instrument of Government was framed on quite different
principles, and the extension of the suffrage and reformed
franchise found no place in England until 1832.
It was not Cromwell&#8217;s fault that it was so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If I relinquish this one of my old historic notions, I feel
that I must do it for the reason that Lord Auckland agreed
with Macaulay after reading the first volume of his history.
&ldquo;I had also hated Cromwell more than I now do,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;for I always agree with Tom Macaulay; and it saves trouble
to agree with him at once, because he is sure to make you
do so at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked Professor Edward Channing of Harvard College,
who teaches English History of the Tudor and Stuart periods,
his opinion of Gardiner. &ldquo;I firmly believe,&rdquo; he told me,
&ldquo;that Mr. Gardiner is the greatest English historical writer
who has appeared since Gibbon. He has the instinct of
the truth-seeker as no other English student I know of has
shown it since the end of the last century.&rdquo;</p>

<p>General J.&nbsp;D. Cox, a statesman and a lawyer, a student of
history and of law, writes to me: &ldquo;In reading Gardiner, I
feel that I am sitting at the feet of an historical chief justice,
a sort of John Marshall in his genius for putting the final
results of learning in the garb of simple common sense.&rdquo;</p>
